Apple,Apple Picks China For Production Of New Mac Pro,29 June 2019,The Wall Street Journal,978 words,0.4071,0.03,0.024,0.946,"Apple Inc. is manufacturing its new Mac Pro computer in China, according to people familiar with its plans, shifting abroad production of what had been its only major device assembled in the U.S. as trade tensions escalate between the Trump administration and Beijing. The tech giant has tapped Taiwanese contractor Quanta Computer Inc. to manufacture the $6,000 desktop computer and is ramping up production at a factory near Shanghai, the people said. Apple can save on shipping costs for components given the proximity of many of its suppliers to Shanghai, rather than having to supply a factory in the U.S. While the Mac Pro isn't one of Apple's higher-volume products, the decision on where to make it carries outsize significance. Apple's reliance on factories in China to manufacture its products has been an issue for the company, especially under President Trump, who has pressured Apple and other companies to make more in the U.S. With the previous Mac Pro model, released in 2013, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook trumpeted plans to build it in the U.S. Apple invested $100 million in tooling and other equipment for a plant in Austin, Texas, run by contract manufacturer Flex Ltd. Each computer was stamped ""Assembled in the USA."" Flex and Quanta declined to comment. An Apple spokesman said the new Mac Pro is designed and engineered in the U.S. and includes U.S.-made components. Apple said it supports manufacturing in 30 U.S. states and spent $60 billion last year with more than 9,000 U.S. suppliers. ""Final assembly is only one part of the manufacturing process,"" the spokesman said, adding that the company's investments support two million American jobs. The Mac Pro is Apple's most powerful computer, used primarily by a relatively small number of professionals working in industries such as film and videogames. President Trump has pressured Apple to make some iPhones, Macs or iPads in the U.S. since the 2016 presidential campaign. He told The Wall Street Journal in 2017 that Mr. Cook promised to build ""three big plants, beautiful plants"" in the U.S., a claim Apple declined to comment on at the time. Last year, as his administration imposed tariffs on imports from China, Mr. Trump said the only way to ensure prices for Apple goods don't increase would be to make products in the U.S. Apple in the past two years has announced a second campus in Austin to handle customer support and operations, and reported more than $500 million in new contracts with U.S. component suppliers that manufacture at home. But Apple hasn't disclosed any plans to build new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Making the new Mac Pro in China isn't likely to affect many workers in Texas because demand for the old model fizzled years ago. The Flex workforce had shifted to refurbishing already-made computers, former Flex employees said. Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, looking to revive trade talks, were scheduled to meet for lunch Saturday at the Group of 20 meeting in Osaka, Japan. Last year, the Trump administration spared product categories including Apple's smartwatch and AirPods wireless earbuds from an initial round of duties. But the administration's proposal to impose additional tariffs of 25% covering $300 billion in imports from China would affect all of Apple's major devices, including the Mac, iPhone and iPad. While it shifts Mac Pro production to China, Apple more broadly is considering moving some of its assembly work out of China because of concerns about U.S. tariffs, The Wall Street Journal has reported. One of the people familiar with Apple's plans said that same consideration could extend to the Mac Pro, with Ireland as an alternate possible site. The Mac Pro's history reflects the hurdles to doing assembly in the U.S. The previous Mac Pro model -- known as the ""trash can"" because of its stumpy, cylindrical appearance -- was the first computer Apple had made in the U.S. in about a decade. Mr. Cook, who had engineered Apple's outsourcing to China, announced plans to build the product in the U.S. in late 2012, when Apple was facing major scrutiny over its reliance on manufacturers in China and those contractors' treatment of workers. Almost immediately, Apple ran into challenges at the Flex plant in Austin, former Apple employees said. More than 80% of the workers across three assembly lines were contract employees paid minimum wage for eight-hour workdays, Alan Hanrahan, a former Apple manufacturing supervisor, said in an interview with the Journal two years ago. As soon as their shift ended, many headed out, he said -- even if the lines were still running. Then production would stop, only to resume when the next shift was in place, he said. As demand for the Mac Pro tapered off, Flex began laying people off, several former Flex employees said. By last year, they were down to a skeleton crew, said Jeff Gruger, a former vice president of product at Flex. ""They learned it's very difficult to manufacture in America,"" Mr. Hanrahan said of Apple in the 2017 interview. Apple this year overhauled the Mac Pro to give it more power and a radically different silver, rectangular design. Manufacturing labor costs in China, though rising, still remain much lower than in the U.S., said Paul Gagnon, a consumer-electronics analyst with IHS Markit. Quanta has made MacBooks and Apple's smartwatch for years. In addition to four facilities in China, the Taiwan-based contractor it has a small facility in Fremont, Calif., where it works on custom desktops, according to one of the people familiar with its plans."
Apple,"EXCHANGE --- Science of Success: When Did We All Start Using Apple Pay? --- It took longer than expected for the iPhone to become a wallet; Apple shows patience isn't a virtue, it's a vicious corporate skill",20 August 2022,The Wall Street Journal,"1,363 words",0.9968,0.122,0.067,0.811,"Patience isn't the most popular virtue in Silicon Valley, where companies aspire to move fast and break things, the motto that defined the age of tech excess. Nothing broke on the day in 2014 when Apple presented a new service called Apple Pay. If the quality of destruction was measured by the speed at which it happened, the flashy innovation from an industry titan would have been considered a disappointment. The idea that it would make the wallet obsolete sounded ridiculous when the pace of Apple Pay adoption underperformed expectations. Wall Street analysts and iPhone users alike were skeptical for the next few years. The experience of using a credit card didn't seem like a problem that required a solution from Apple. It's a bet that now appears to be paying off in a very strange way for our hit-driven economy: slowly. Apple has been picked apart for so many lessons that it could start its own business school, but what the case of Apple Pay shows is that patience is a competitive edge for companies that know how to wield it. Patience often sounds like a dirty word to our tech overlords -- Steve Jobs wasn't exactly Job -- but only time can break certain habits of human behavior. Trillions of dollars in market cap buys that kind of time. Not every company has the luxury of playing the long game, but it was an indulgence the world's richest corporation could afford. The percentage of iPhones with Apple Pay activated was 10% in 2016 and 20% in 2017, according to research from Loup Ventures, as most people seemed perfectly happy with their plastic cards and leather wallets. Adoption nearly doubled again in 2018. It hit 50% by 2020. Now it's around 75% and inching closer to ubiquity. Of course, not every account that gets activated remains in active use. So what changed? We did. Apple's executives remained confident about the future even when the present wasn't so rosy because they could look at the rest of the world's acceptance of contactless payments and see that the U.S. was lagging years behind. It would take work to build the technological infrastructure for iPhone users to start using Apple Pay. It would also take waiting for the public to get comfortable with change. The company's data suggested that customers were pleased with Apple Pay once they tried it. ""People love Apple Pay,"" Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster said in a recent interview. Apple just needed more customers to use it. And its pestering worked. The company says that 90% of retailers across the U.S. now take Apple Pay. The number that accepted contactless payments when the service was introduced was 3%. The more places that accept Apple Pay, the more value the service provides, and the more people upload their credit and debit cards to the Wallet app. They can use Apple Pay to order stuff online, send money to friends and buy things in a physical store by holding it near a contactless reader. The fees Apple collects from banks whose cardholders use Apple Pay amount to less than 1% of the company's overall revenue, according to Mr. Munster's estimates, but Apple generates so much profit from iPhone sales that even billions of dollars would be a rounding error. Apple Pay exists to improve the iPhone experience. The activation rate of Apple Pay has begun to resemble the classic trajectory of tech adoption, which suggests that what is now a tiny slice of Apple's pie can get much bigger, along with the overall market for contactless payments. Such tap-to-pay spending accounts for nearly 20% of Visa's face-to-face transactions in the U.S., but the rates in big cities have climbed above 25%, with the Bay Area at 30% and New York reaching 45%. Apple Pay is also the top payment app for teenagers, according to investment firm Piper Sandler. As teens and cities go, so goes the nation. Apple's rhetoric was ahead of reality for most of Apple Pay's existence. Chief Executive Tim Cook once predicted that 2015 would be ""the year of Apple Pay."" In 2016, he declared that it would kill cash. In 2018, he conceded that mobile payments hadn't taken off as he expected. ""Does it matter if we get there in two years, three years, five years?"" Apple Senior Vice President Eddy Cue said five years ago. ""Ultimately, no."" Apple hasn't confused patience with stubbornness. Apple moved quickly to discontinue the HomePod speaker three years after the product hit the market, for example, and no amount of patience would have been enough to save the iPod. But in this case time was on Apple's side. The company said revenue from Apple Pay doubled in 2019, and Mr. Cook sounded triumphant early this year. ""The growth of Apple Pay has just been stunning,"" he said on a January earnings call. Apple says the ultimate goal is giving users ""the option to replace their physical wallet with a secure, private and easy to use mobile wallet."" Apple Pay has become the scaffolding for the company to build a much larger business. Apple dipped a toe in finance in 2019 by collaborating with Goldman Sachs on the Apple Card and plunged deeper by announcing a ""buy now, pay later"" option expected later this year. Its ambitions have the attention of analysts, the concern of rivals and the scrutiny of regulators. European antitrust authorities recently accused the company of abusing its market power to favor Apple Pay; Apple has said that it's cooperating with the investigation. Apple eventually wants your virtual wallet to contain everything from your driver's license to insurance cards, but the company has learned that the process of replacing physical objects doesn't happen overnight. It barely happens over decades. ""There's a legitimate chicken-and-egg problem in payments,"" said Bernstein analyst Harshita Rawat. ""Consumer habits are very hard to change, and merchant acceptance takes many, many, many years."" The consumer habit that will take the longest to change also happens to be the one with the greatest rewards. The biggest pool of money in the U.S. mobile-payments business is the cash register, said Gerard du Toit, a Bain & Co. partner, and Apple is narrowingly leading a crowded pack with the highest share of digital payments in physical stores. But its rival isn't just Cash App and PayPal or Google and Samsung. It's the convenience of credit cards. And those are still winning. Apple's executives argue the enhanced security of Apple Pay helps make for a superior consumer experience, but there is not yet a compelling reason to pick a phone over plastic. Unlike scanning a mobile boarding pass, which took off in barely any time because it eliminated the hassle of printing, Apple Pay doesn't reduce much friction. I spent the past few weeks leaving cards in my pocket and tapping my phone wherever I could. But there are still plenty of places where I couldn't. Restaurants have been slow to embrace the technology required for Apple Pay. Gas stations have been reluctant to spend on upgrading their pumps. Walmart, which favors its own mobile payment option, remains the most notable holdout among retailers. People would rather leave home without their wallets than without their phones, according to Bain surveys, but that fantasy is only realistic if mobile payments become as reliable as credit cards. Even if 90% of merchants take Apple Pay, the remaining 10% has an outsize effect. It seems likely that Apple will get there -- maybe not immediately, but eventually. Success for Apple Pay looks different now than it did eight years ago. Eight years from now, it will be unrecognizable again. Apple can wait. It takes patience to reap the benefits of patience."
Apple,Tech,5 February 2018,WSJ Pro Venture Capital,"1,018 words",0.9948,0.092,0.027,0.882,"English , Inc. Apple Music is on the verge of overtaking Spotify AB in U.S. paid subscribers, a sign that the music-streaming world's dominant force is facing growing competition ahead of its hotly anticipated public stock offering . Apple Inc.'s streaming-music service, introduced in June 2015 , has been adding subscribers in the U.S. more rapidly than its older Swedish rival—a monthly growth rate of 5% versus 2%—according to people in the music business familiar with figures reported by the two services. Assuming that pace continues, Apple will overtake Spotify in the world's biggest music market this summer. Apple's music-streaming service has been quietly gaining ground in part thanks to the popularity of the company's devices: Apple Music comes preloaded on all iPhones, Apple Watches and other hardware the company sells. Globally, however, Spotify remains in a league of its own, with nearly twice as many paid subscribers as No. 2 Apple, and slightly faster subscriber growth. Other players in paid streaming music include Pandora Media Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube. Streaming services have fueled a recovery in the recording industry after years of declines amid plummeting sales of CDs and, more recently, downloads. Streaming customers pay a flat monthly fee or listen to ads in exchange for unlimited access to vast music catalogs; with downloads, consumers pay for individual songs or albums once and own them permanently. Paid subscriptions, up 61%, were the largest source of record-company revenue in the U.S. in the first half of 2017, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. But music streaming has yet to prove itself as a viable business as the tech companies operating these services struggle to make them profitable. Active users and paid subscribers are the most closely watched metrics as these services grow. One question lingering in the industry is what metrics Spotify will have to disclose once it becomes a publicly traded company. The service has periodically released global subscriber totals and just last month touted a new high of 70 million. Apple Music told The Wall Street Journal it now has 36 million paid global users, up from the 30 million it last reported in September. But both companies' numbers are boosted by counting individual users who are part of family plans and people with discounted subscriptions bundled with other services. In some countries, mobile-phone plans can include an Apple Music subscription; Spotify offers students in the U.S. a subscription plan that includes video-service Hulu . Neither company publicly breaks out figures for the U.S. or any other single market. In their licensing deals, music labels let streaming services pay lower royalty rates for music when they meet certain subscription-growth targets. As part of those deals, the services are required to report how many accounts they have—a number not inflated by multiple users on a family subscription. They also must report the number of monthly active subscribers they have, stripping out people who were signed up in bundle deals but don't use the service and are likely to churn. By one standard, Apple Music has already passed Spotify. Including people who are still in free or deeply discounted trial periods leading up to a paid subscription, Apple Music has a slight edge on Spotify in the U.S., according to one of the people familiar with the figures. Apple Music has three to four times the number of such trial users as Spotify, according to this person, in part because it doesn't offer a free tier of service. Also, all Apple Music subscribers are entered automatically into a free initial three-month period. Excluding those trial users, Spotify is ahead, but by a small amount—and that gap is closing. Apple's services segment, which includes Apple Music as well as the App Store and its payment services, was a bright spot in the company's earnings posted last week, with an 18% jump in revenue. It is unclear how much Apple Music contributed to that increase as the company doesn't break out the streaming service's results. Launched in 2008, Spotify lets users listen to a library of more than 30 million songs on demand. It started offering its service in the U.S. in 2011. Subscribers who shell out $9.99 a month can listen without hearing ads; users of the free version need to sit through ads and have more limited ability to pick the order in which they hear the songs they select. As of June, Spotify said it has 140 million active users world-wide. The company has been targeting March or April for its market debut, said people familiar with the matter. Spotify has never reported a profit, but has said it believes it can become profitable once it has amassed sufficient users, without specifying what that scale would be. Apple Music allows users to stream from a catalog of 45 million songs or play from their own iTunes library. It has only ever offered an individual $9.99-a-month subscription tier. Both Spotify and Apple Music offer $4.99-a-month student plans and $14.99-a-month family plans, which up to six individuals can use. Spotify is available in 61 territories, including the U.S. Apple Music is available in 115. Next week, Apple will begin selling its voice-activated speaker , HomePod, which it has tried to differentiate from competitors' offerings by promising better-sound quality. The device has been marketed as a way to listen to Apple Music, which it will play directly; other music-streaming services can be played only over Apple's AirPlay. The introduction of theHomePod has the potential to boost Apple Music subscriptions.

Apple,WSJ Pro,3 January 2019,WSJ Pro Central Banking,571 words,0.9525,0.128,0.096,0.775,"English , Inc. It's rare that company earnings news would by itself be of major interest to the Fed, but not every company is technology giant Apple Inc. The firm startled investors Wednesday when it cut earnings guidance . And the firm didn't blame American consumers. ""While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,"" Apple leader Tim Cook wrote. ""In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100% of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China."" President Trump's trade fight with China played a starring role in Apple's troubles. Mr. Cook wrote that China began to slow last year and has booked some of its slowest forward momentum in a quarter-century. What's more, ""we believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States."" That's a flashing yellow light for an American economy that is already expected to book slower growth in 2019 after a solid 2018. So far, the U.S. economy has managed to weather the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs relatively well, with economists and policy makers struggling to find a tangible impact. Some central bankers have even expressed sympathy for Mr. Trump's hard line on China. Minneapolis Fed leader Neel Kashkari recently said he was ""broadly sympathetic with the view that 20 years of talking to China hasn't gotten us anywhere, so we need to—there needs to be another approach,"" although he declined to say whether Mr. Trump had found it. Global growth is nevertheless a concern for the Fed. It said in its December Federal Open Market Committee meeting statement that it was monitoring overseas events. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at the post-FOMC press conference the central bank has seen a modest slowdown in global growth, while adding "" you have still healthy levels of growth in the aggregate around the world."" Apple's announcement suggests China, the U.S.'s largest trading partner, could be more problematic than most now expect. At the same time, the drag China has placed on Apple stands to have a negative influence on stocks given the company's big role in equity markets. More bad news after a tough December for stocks also could weigh on consumer and business confidence and wealth effects that had flowed from rising equity prices. The Fed was already facing a difficult year when it comes to monetary policy. Its push for higher rates has been muddied by still low inflation despite a red hot job market. Mr. Trump's repeated attacks on the Fed's rate increases add another challenge. Meanwhile, the bond market is signaling the possibility of a downturn, and a recent survey of corporate financial chiefs sees a good chance of a near-term recession. If the implosion of demand that hit Apple is broader based, that means headwinds from overseas economies may increase. And that's not good news, anyway you look at it.

Apple,Today's Markets,20 June 2020,The Wall Street Journal Online,968 words,0.9682,0.079,0.059,0.861,"Corrections & Amplifications All three major U.S. stock indexes posted weekly gains of at least 1%. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said they rose at least 1.7%. (Corrected on June 19) The Dow Jones Industrial Average abruptly turned lower Friday after Apple said it was closing some stores due to a rise in coronavirus cases, stoking fears of another lockdown. During a choppy day of trading, the Dow rallied at the opening bell, swung more than 600 points on the Apple news, then staged a partial comeback in the last hour of the session. In the end, the blue-chip index closed down 208.64 points, or 0.8%, at 25871.46. The S&P 500 dropped 17.60 points, or 0.6%, to 3097.74. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 3.07 points, or less than 0.1%, to 9946.12. All three indexes posted weekly gains of at least 1%, reversing a sharp drop last week. The increases were fueled by central-bank stimulus efforts and cautious optimism that the economy is recovering from the worst fallout of the pandemic. Still, investors have been sensitive to any indications of a second wave of infections, out of fear that it could lead to new lockdowns, reversing the trend toward reopening the U.S. economy that has lifted the stock market since it bottomed out in March. Apple said Friday that it was temporarily shutting 11 stores across Florida, Arizona, North Carolina and South Carolina, following spikes in Covid-19 infections. The market sold off sharply on the news. Earlier in the week, investors had been cheered by a string of economic data suggesting that the U.S. economy is recovering, with retail sales rebounding and jobless claims easing . ""The things you saw in March—the panic and forced selling—all seem to have faded, so it's a bit more of a normal market, though a fragile one,"" said Jonas Golterman, senior markets economist at Capital Economics. ""The ingrained reflex which we have had in the past 10 years is, we have to buy the dip, and that usually works out."" More * Chinese Index Turns Positive for the Year * Investors Edge Into Emerging Markets Early coronavirus testing data from U.S. states and cities, including Minnesota, where the police killing of George Floyd sparked global protests, suggest recent mass gatherings haven't led to a marked uptick in new cases. New cases in Florida, Arizona and California have hit daily record highs in recent days, but authorities have been reluctant to put lockdown measures back in place. Authorities in California are requiring residents to wear face masks in high-risk settings. Investors have cheered signs that the U.S. economy is reopening, allowing people to return to work and business activity to pick up. ""At the moment, people just seemed very focused on the strength of the recovery, which is to be expected given the strength of the shutdown,"" said Lyn Graham-Taylor, fixed-income strategist at Rabobank. ""Through the summer, the economic data will be mechanically good just because it's going off such a low base, so it will take time to find out what the economic scarring is."" Markets have also gotten a boost from the stimulus efforts of central banks, with the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank all stepping up efforts in recent weeks to buy bonds and inject money into their economies to alleviate the impact of the pandemic. Some analysts cited fear of missing out as another driver behind this week's gains. ""We suspect there are a lot of people who sold at the bottom, and now they have regret and remorse over not buying sooner,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Potentially adding to volatility Friday was quadruple witching, which occurs four times a year and refers to the day that options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire at the same time. That tends to cause heavy trading volume as traders adjust expiring positions. Ten of the S&P 500's 11 sectors were negative Friday. Health care was the only sector in positive territory. Shares of Apple dropped $2.01, or 0.6%, to $349.72. The stock hit a record intraday high on Friday morning before the news of its store closures. AMC Entertainment fell 11 cents, or 2%, to $5.52 in a volatile day of trading. The cinema chain reported plans late Thursday to reopen most of its movie theaters in July, sending its stock up. But shares turned lower after the company said it would require moviegoers to wear masks, a reversal of its earlier stance. CarMax shares tumbled $6.04, or 6.2%, to $91.87 after the auto retailer reported that its profit for the last quarter contracted sharply amid the pandemic. Oil prices rose to a three-month high. New York crude futures climbed 2.3% to settle at $39.75. New data showed a further decline in the count of U.S. oil rigs, a bullish sign for the energy markets as it shows oil drillers are reining in production. Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 climbed 0.6%. Most major Asian markets closed higher. The Shanghai Composite rallied 1%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note settled at 0.696%, up from 0.693% Thursday.

Apple's executives remained confident about the future even when the present wasn't so rosy because they could look at the rest of the world's acceptance of contactless payments and see that the U.S. was lagging years behind. It would take work to build the technological infrastructure for iPhone users to start using Apple Pay. It would also take waiting for the public to get comfortable with change . The company's data suggested that customers were pleased with Apple Pay once they tried it. ""People love Apple Pay,"" Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster said in a recent interview. Apple just needed more customers to use it. And its pestering worked. The company says that 90% of retailers across the U.S. now take Apple Pay. The number that accepted contactless payments when the service was introduced was 3%. The more places that accept Apple Pay, the more value the service provides, and the more people upload their credit and debit cards to the Wallet app. They can use Apple Pay to order stuff online, send money to friends and buy things in a physical store by holding it near a contactless reader. The fees Apple collects from banks whose cardholders use Apple Pay amount to less than 1% of the company's overall revenue, according to Mr. Munster's estimates, but Apple generates so much profit from iPhone sales that even billions of dollars would be a rounding error. Apple Pay exists to improve the iPhone experience. The activation rate of Apple Pay has begun to resemble the classic trajectory of tech adoption, which suggests that what is now a tiny slice of Apple's pie can get much bigger, along with the overall market for contactless payments. Such tap-to-pay spending accounts for nearly 20% of Visa's face-to-face transactions in the U.S., but the rates in big cities have climbed above 25%, with the Bay Area at 30% and New York reaching 45%. Apple Pay is also the top payment app for teenagers , according to investment firm Piper Sandler. As teens and cities go, so goes the nation. Apple's rhetoric was ahead of reality for most of Apple Pay's existence . Chief Executive Tim Cook once predicted that 2015 would be ""the year of Apple Pay."" In 2016, he declared that it would kill cash. In 2018, he conceded that mobile payments hadn't taken off as he expected. ""Does it matter if we get there in two years, three years, five years?"" Apple Senior Vice President Eddy Cue said five years ago. ""Ultimately, no."" Apple hasn't confused patience with stubbornness. Apple moved quickly to discontinue the HomePod speaker three years after the product hit the market, for example, and no amount of patience would have been enough to save the iPod . But in this case time was on Apple's side. The company said revenue from Apple Pay doubled in 2019, and Mr. Cook sounded triumphant early this year. ""The growth of Apple Pay has just been stunning,"" he said on a January earnings call. Apple says the ultimate goal is giving users ""the option to replace their physical wallet with a secure, private and easy to use mobile wallet."" Apple Pay has become the scaffolding for the company to build a much larger business. Apple dipped a toe in finance in 2019 by collaborating with Goldman Sachs on the Apple Card and plunged deeper by announcing a ""buy now, pay later"" option expected later this year. Its ambitions have the attention of analysts, the concern of rivals and the scrutiny of regulators. European antitrust authorities recently accused the company of abusing its market power to favor Apple Pay; Apple has said that it's cooperating with the investigation. Apple eventually wants your virtual wallet to contain everything from your driver's license to insurance cards, but the company has learned that the process of replacing physical objects doesn't happen overnight. It barely happens over decades. ""There's a legitimate chicken-and-egg problem in payments,"" said Bernstein analyst Harshita Rawat. ""Consumer habits are very hard to change, and merchant acceptance takes many, many, many years."" The consumer habit that will take the longest to change also happens to be the one with the greatest rewards. The biggest pool of money in the U.S. mobile-payments business is the cash register, said Gerard du Toit, a Bain & Company partner, and Apple is narrowingly leading a crowded pack with the highest share of digital payments in physical stores. But its rival isn't just Cash App and PayPal or Google and Samsung. It's the convenience of credit cards. And those are still winning. Apple's executives argue the enhanced security of Apple Pay helps make for a superior consumer experience, but there is not yet a compelling reason to pick a phone over plastic. Unlike scanning a mobile boarding pass, which took off in barely any time because it eliminated the hassle of printing, Apple Pay doesn't reduce much friction. I spent the past few weeks leaving cards in my pocket and tapping my phone wherever I could. But there are still plenty of places where I couldn't. Restaurants have been slow to embrace the technology required for Apple Pay. Gas stations have been reluctant to spend on upgrading their pumps. Walmart, which favors its own mobile payment option, remains the most notable holdout among retailers. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How have Apple Pay and other mobile-payment options affected your habits? Join the conversation below. People would rather leave home without their wallets than without their phones, according to Bain surveys, but that fantasy is only realistic if mobile payments become as reliable as credit cards. Even if 90% of merchants take Apple Pay, the remaining 10% has an outsize effect. It seems likely that Apple will get there—maybe not immediately, but eventually. Success for Apple Pay looks different now than it did eight years ago. Eight years from now, it will be unrecognizable again. Apple can wait. It takes patience to reap the benefits of patience. Wait, When Did Everyone Start Using Apple Pay? (""https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-pay-iphone-wallet-apps-11660780139"")"
Apple,Technology,14 December 2018,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,229 words",0.9953,0.095,0.014,0.892,"Apple Inc. plans to invest $1 billion to build a second campus in Austin, Texas, for 5,000 employees, widening its footprint in a familiar region rich with engineering and business talent as it joins other tech giants in expanding beyond the West Coast. The iPhone maker laid out its strategy Thursday in an announcement about new jobs it will add across the country. The move would be a step toward fulfilling a pledge made in January when it said it would invest $30 billion in capital spending and create 20,000 jobs in the U.S. over the next five years. Apple said it would add more than 1,000 employees apiece in San Diego, Seattle and Culver City, Calif., areas where it has been increasing staff to support its development of custom chips, machine-learning systems and Hollywood programming. It also plans hundreds of additional jobs in cities where it already has offices, including New York, Boston and Portland, Ore. The Austin campus would have the capacity to eventually accommodate 15,000 employees, Apple said, and was expected to make the company the city's largest private employer. The announcement came weeks after Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. said they would expand in regions where they already have a presence. Amazon last month awarded campuses to New York and Northern Virginia, bringing 25,000 jobs to each area; Alphabet said its Google unit would double its workforce in New York to more than 14,000 over the next 10 years. The tech industry's growth in recent years has challenged companies to push beyond their headquarters for new talent, particularly as living costs rise and options for nearby expansion dwindle. Instead of spreading operations into new pockets of the country, though, the companies have opted for familiar locales where they already have a presence. ""You have an element of bet-the-company on each location,"" said Jeff Forsythe, an adviser with the consulting firm Forsythe & Associates Inc., which helps companies choose new sites. ""If you're comfortable doing business in an area, it doesn't hurt to grow in the same area."" All three companies have been eager to claim credit for creating American jobs as their power grows and their market values soar. President Trump has applied specific pressure to Apple, calling on it repeatedly to bring manufacturing jobs home from Asia. Apple's choice of Austin is a surprise in one respect. After the company said in January it would select the location of a new campus by year's end, Chief Executive Tim Cook said the facility would be outside of California and Texas, where Apple already has substantial operations. An Apple spokeswoman declined to say if the Austin expansion is the promised new campus. The company in its announcement said there is potential for additional expansion in the U.S. over time. In making its decision, Amazon also pivoted late in its process, opting to spread what was supposed to be a second headquarters with 50,000 jobs across two locations. Apple and Amazon approached their campus searches and announcements differently. Apple discreetly explored options in markets such as North Carolina and Northern Virginia, according to people familiar with the search. The company announced its selection of Austin overnight. Amazon, meanwhile, held a more than yearlong, public search with the fanfare of an Olympics host-city selection process. The e-commerce giant received 238 proposals and winnowed the list to 20 finalists before trumpeting its choice of Northern Virginia and New York's Long Island City neighborhood in the morning hours of Nov. 13, maximizing its potential for attention. It also said it was creating more than 5,000 jobs at a new campus in Nashville, Tenn. The expansion comes as business challenges mount for Apple. Its shares have dropped more than 25% since early October, shedding more than $300 billion in market value, driven in part by investors' concerns about the future of the iPhone. In Austin, Apple committed to spending at least $400 million on the campus, according to its 15-year pact with Williamson County, where the campus will be located. The company said those jobs would be in areas including customer support, engineering, finance, sales and operations. In exchange, the governor's office said the state has pledged to extend $25 million to Apple from the Texas Enterprise Fund, contingent on Williamson County passing a property-tax package next Tuesday that would give Apple a 65% tax break annually. Those incentives are in addition to $21 million the state committed in 2012 over 10 years for Apple's current Austin campus , which has doubled the company's local workforce. Apple now employs 6,200 people in the area, the largest concentration of Apple employees outside of its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. A longtime lure of Austin, which once promoted itself as the Silicon Hills, has been its low cost of living compared with San Francisco and New York, as well as its lack of a state income tax. The metro-area population of 2.1 million residents is younger and better educated than the rest of Texas and the U.S. It hosts music festivals throughout the year and has a surfeit of high-end restaurants. That has made it attractive to the type of younger workers companies want to hire. Austin was a dark horse in the quest to land Amazon's second headquarters, dubbed HQ2. Google and Facebook Inc. also have opened large offices in Texas' capital city. The area is home to Dell Technologies Inc., while chip giant NXP Semiconductors NV has a major presence there after buying Freescale Semiconductor in 2015. Many videogame companies have studios around town. Texas has more representation in Washington than other states Apple considered, potentially giving Apple more clout on Capitol Hill at a time when tech companies face increasing scrutiny over issues such as digital privacy and antitrust, said John Boyd, principal at the Boyd Co., a site-selection firm. Austin also has been one of two U.S. locations where Apple has manufacturing operations. In 2012, amid mounting criticism of its reliance on overseas manufacturing, Apple said it would invest $100 million to make the Mac Pro its first ""Assembled in the USA"" product in years. The project in Austin was led by Flex Ltd. Mr. Trump has renewed calls for Apple to shift manufacturing to the U.S. from China, where most iPhones are assembled. Analysts and people familiar with Apple's operations say it isn't easy to shift production out of China. Much of the electronics supply chain is based in China and neighboring countries, and many steps of assembling the iPhones still rely on the hands of hundreds of thousands of workers. The new 133-acre Austin campus will be located less than a mile from Apple's existing facilities. The company added 6,000 jobs in the U.S. and now employs 90,000 people in country, many retail workers at its stores. Russell Gold, Yoko Kubota and Stu Woo contributed to this article. and Timothy W.

Apple,Apple's App Store Finds Adversaries Everywhere --- Companies from Facebook to Epic Games to Spotify say tech giant wields monopoly power,28 September 2020,The Wall Street Journal,"1,165 words",-0.9245,0.056,0.07,0.874,"A host of companies, including Facebook Inc., Spotify Technology SA and ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games Inc., are challenging the way Apple Inc. runs its App Store. The App Store generates at least $15 billion in annual sales for the tech giant, according to analysts' estimates. Critics say Apple takes too big a cut of app makers' sales and wields monopoly power over the gateway that connects hundreds of millions of users to mobile apps. Apple disputes that characterization, saying that it collects only a portion of sales from a small percentage of the almost 2 million apps available on the App Store and that its practices are in line with competitors' app marketplaces. Here is an overview of recent challenges to the App Store model and what they mean for consumers and the company. APP STORE FEES Apple takes a 30% cut on sales of paid apps and digital goods sold within apps. Numerous companies have complained that the fee is excessive and are pressing Apple to allow alternate payment systems to process digital transactions. Apple's fee is in line with those charged in Google's Google Play store and Samsung Electronics Co.'s Samsung Galaxy Store. Apple said the commission helps cover overhead costs such as security and privacy. Last month, Epic Games attempted to skirt Apple's commission by adding its own payment system to the version of ""Fortnite"" played on iPhones and iPads. Apple quickly removed the shooter-survival game from the App Store, saying Epic violated its rules. The two companies are now suing each other over the matter, with Epic claiming ""Fortnite"" should be allowed back into the App Store with its payment system intact and Apple saying Epic should be restricted from engaging in what it calls unfair business practices. A judge ruled last month that Apple can keep ""Fortnite"" out of the App Store for now, but the company can't block Epic's access to developer tools used to update software. A court hearing in the case is scheduled for Monday. A trial is likely to take place next year. SALES PRESSURE Apple's 30% commission on digital goods and services means that a customer's payments to Epic for ""Fortnite"" weapons are subject to the fee, but purchases of coffee in Starbucks Corp.'s mobile app aren't. For subscriptions purchased via the App Store, Apple's cut falls to 15% after the first year. Apple also collects an annual fee from developers who submit software to be distributed via the App Store, with exceptions for nonprofits and government entities. To sidestep Apple's cut, Netflix Inc., Spotify and other companies have shifted to selling subscriptions and downloads via their websites instead of their apps. Apple bars companies from mentioning in their apps where consumers can go to subscribe, and it doesn't allow companies to say they are offering higher prices in app purchases to offset Apple's fee. Companies switching from selling real-world goods to digital ones amid the pandemic -- such as Airbnb Inc., which now sells travelers virtual experiences such as cooking classes -- have complained that Apple wanted a cut of those sales. COMPETITION Some app developers say Apple limits competition and ranks its own products ahead of rivals' products in App Store search results. Spotify filed an antitrust complaint in Europe last year claiming that Apple, whose Apple Music service competes with Spotify, made it difficult for rival services to market themselves in the App Store. The music-streaming company this month accused Apple in public statements of unfairly harming competitors after the tech giant unveiled a new bundle giving users access to multiple Apple services, including Music, at a discounted price. A spokeswoman for Spotify said the company is concerned that Apple is using its market power and app marketplace to advantage its own products. Apple defended its new bundle, saying it would recommend a plan to customers ""that saves you the most money based on the subscriptions you already have."" Microsoft Corp., Facebook, Tinder owner Match Group Inc. and Audiobooks.com also have publicly complained about Apple's practices or described the company as monopolistic. Apple has repeatedly said it doesn't give its own products an advantage. Congress, the Justice Department, European Union and Federal Trade Commission investigating Apple and other tech companies on antitrust grounds. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that consumers can sue Apple for forcing them to buy apps exclusively from the tech giant. The ruling didn't address plaintiffs' claims that apps would be cheaper if software developers could sell them directly and bypass Apple. A lawsuit filed last year by developers over App Store practices is ongoing in California federal court. It helps to be a big name when going up against one of the world's largest companies. In 2015, Taylor Swift complained that three-month trial subscriptions to Apple Music meant artists went unpaid when users streamed their music through the service. Apple later changed the policy and pays artists for music streamed via trial memberships. Amazon.com Inc. successfully pushed back against the App Store commission, in 2016 striking a deal that sets a 15% commission on subscription sales to Amazon Prime Video and not the 30% fee that all other apps are required to pay on first-year digital-subscription sales. In April, Amazon began using its own payment system to fulfill Prime Video purchases through its app with Apple's blessing. Apple has said that is because Amazon is in a program for ""premium subscription video entertainment providers,"" which permits members to use the payment method tied to customers' existing video subscriptions. In August, a trade body representing the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and other publishers said the outlets want better deal terms from Apple on their digital-subscription sales. Apple on Friday said it is cutting its commission on some paid events and experiences sold through mobile apps through the end of 2020. A company spokesman said the move is a recognition that some businesses have had to switch to online experiences as the pandemic halted many in-person gatherings and events. Apple has faced plenty of disputes since its inception in a Los Altos, Calif., garage 44 years ago, and rarely gives up ground to opponents. But where adversaries in years past complained about things including Apple's iTunes music service and e-book pricing, companies today are targeting a source of revenue that Chief Executive Tim Cook has put at the heart of the tech giant's future. Some software developers formed a nonprofit to press for changes to app marketplaces. It is unclear whether decisions from courts or regulators will prompt Apple to adjust its rules or whether the company will try to hold firm in the face of pushback."
Apple,"EXCHANGE --- Technology -- Keywords: In Apple's Third Act, The iPhone Plays a Supporting Role --- What will be the tech giant's next big thing? Look for an expanding ecosystem of wearable computers.",8 September 2018,The Wall Street Journal,"1,090 words",0.9922,0.078,0.025,0.897,"We are entering the third age of Apple. A PC company first, and now very much the trillion-dollar iPhone company, Apple Inc. is evidently in search of its next big thing. Speculation about what that might be runs rampant every time a new Apple skunkworks project is revealed, be it a self-driving car, a health-care push or a pair of augmented-reality goggles. While the services that come paired with iPhones are themselves a substantial and growing part of Apple's revenue, they will continue to need hardware to lock in customers. I'm placing my bet on a small but already thriving component of Apple's portfolio: wearables. In the company's last earnings call, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company's Apple Watch and AirPods headphones generated $10 billion in revenue across the past four quarters. True, Apple made nearly $30 billion in iPhone revenue in its most recent quarter alone, but wearables sales are growing at a time when smartphone and PC sales are stagnating. Tech research firm IDC named Apple the wearables market leader, with a 17% global share. Next week, Apple is expected to announce a new Apple Watch and AirPods along with a passel of new iPhones. There probably isn't anything revolutionary here, but the updates will no doubt power Apple's relentless push toward its wearable aspirations. The new Apple Watch will likely be a more capable health monitor and phone replacement, while the new AirPods will be a bridge to Siri and other apps. What is apparent is that Apple is building out an ecosystem of wearable computers that its customers will buy some subset of, depending on their needs. Still on the horizon are augmented-reality wearables -- perhaps glasses or goggles -- and other sensors on our bodies or in our environments that provide additional ways to monitor health. Every device could get its own Apple-designed chip and wireless connectivity, giving it the potential to become its own platform. And the ever-improving iPhone becomes less a ""phone"" and more of a local hub for the ""body area network."" This becomes particularly relevant with augmented reality. The potential of AR is a topic Mr. Cook has brought up again and again, and described in terms that border on hyperbolic even for a CEO known for being upbeat. In November, he told analysts he believed AR ""is going to change the way we use technology forever."" Yet current attempts at AR seem mostly like demonstrations of how profoundly difficult it is to pull off. In what might be called true AR, objects are superimposed over our world so that they look real. Currently, Apple's ARKit can add digital objects only to what you see through an iPhone. Even the current leaders in the field of AR optics, Microsoft Corp. and Magic Leap Inc., have so far delivered only bulky, awkward headsets. This is likely why Apple purchased Akonia Holographics, a startup that makes lenses for AR glasses. It's also likely why Apple watchers don't expect any AR goggles at Wednesday's iPhone hoedown. If Apple's past playbook is any indication, the first AR headsets the company does eventually release will probably be impressive but limited -- most useful in conjunction with the iPhone. That is to say, they'd work like Apple Watches: great at giving you glanceable information, stupendous at one or two things that only AR glasses can do, but not themselves replacements for iPhones. There are potentially other directions Apple could go in wearables, especially with health sensors. In 2017, Apple acquired sleep-tracking hardware maker Beddit. The company is in talks with the Food and Drug Administration about future health-tracking software. And Apple has patented a system for tracking heart rate through earbuds. All of these incremental advances could expand Apple's market share and reach. And it's that revenue -- in services and semiannual hardware upgrades -- that matters most for Apple's future. Sales of Apple-made wearables may never eclipse those of the iPhone, yet wearables could still be the most important driver of Apple's overall business. The key is the portion of the company's revenue that comes from services -- a piece of the pie that's been growing even faster than wearables sales. In 2017, ""services"" was already a $30 billion business at Apple, and in the company's most recent quarter, it accounted for nearly $10 billion. Because Apple's services include subscriptions and sales from iCloud, the App Store, Apple Pay and Apple Music, this slice of revenue doesn't fluctuate as dramatically as hardware sales. All of Apple's wearables are not only compatible with Apple's services, but also seem designed to enhance those revenue streams. Consider the fact that a cellular-connected Apple Watch Series 3 can stream only Apple Music, or that Siri is the only smart assistant you can summon directly from Apple's AirPods. ""When you get right down to it, is it about Apple's hardware? Yes, but I'd argue it's really about having the [Apple] experience on any device you choose to carry, wear or put on,"" says Ramon Llamas, an analyst at IDC. Anytime there is a change to how we use computers, there's potential for an upset to existing hierarchies. As the first U.S.-listed trillion-dollar company, Apple might seem to be well positioned to dominate the era of wearables. But if wearable computing becomes more about access to the cloud, there's another trillion-dollar company that's had more success in cloud computing, as well as in selling those now nearly ubiquitous talking speakers. (Yes, I'm talking about Amazon.com Inc.) Here's how Apple maintains its edge and becomes the dominant wearables company: It makes the most capable and one of the most popular smartwatches in the world, but ensures that it's not as useful without other Apple gadgets and services. Next, it repeats that logic for every class of wearable it eventually makes, be it headphones, glasses, health monitors or others. The result is a self-reinforcing halo effect, in which buying one Apple device pulls you into a whole world of Apple that is easier to remain in -- and keep buying -- than to ever leave."
Apple,Technology,9 September 2020,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,035 words",-0.1108,0.055,0.065,0.88,"Apple Inc. swung back at Epic Games Inc. in a counter-lawsuit accusing the software developer of duplicity and greed, intensifying a legal battle over the iPhone maker's online software store that could reshape how the marketplace operates. At the core of the dispute is how much control Apple exerts in the expansive world of smartphone apps that have changed how modern life operates and ushered in the platforms for everything from home entertainment and videogames to on-demand food ordering and ride hailing. Epic sued Apple as well as Google last month after the tech giants yanked the popular ""Fortnite"" videogame from their app marketplaces, calling the power both companies hold over developers monopolistic. Apple and Google removed the game after Epic introduced an in-app payment system in violation of their rules that would cut out both companies from receiving a 30% cut of users' spending. In court documents filed Tuesday, Apple defended its actions and went further, asking a federal judge in California to award punitive damages and restrict Epic from continuing what it describes as unfair business practices. ""Epic's lawsuit is nothing more than a basic disagreement over money,"" Apple said in its filing Tuesday. ""Although Epic portrays itself as a modern corporate Robin Hood, in reality it is a multi-billion dollar enterprise that simply wants to pay nothing for the tremendous value it derives from the App Store."" An Epic spokesman declined to comment beyond what the company has said previously about fighting what it describes as a system that suppresses competition and inflates prices. While Epic and Apple seek to litigate their dispute, the game maker filed a motion Friday seeking to get Fortnite back in the App Store while that fight continues. A hearing is scheduled for Sept. 28. ""All Epic seeks is for the court to stop Apple from retaliating against Epic for daring to challenge Apple's misconduct,"" Epic said in last week's filing. Closely held Epic is just the latest company to take issue with Apple's control of the App Store, which is part of the Cupertino, Calif.-company's evolution to expand beyond selling hardware and to generate revenue from software services. Apple's App Store in the first seven months of this year generated nearly $39 billion in global revenue from in-app purchases, subscriptions and premium apps, according to researcher Sensor Tower. After its launch in 2008, the App Store has about one billion customers from 175 countries. Apple is facing antitrust probes from governments in the U.S. and Europe while other tech companies from Microsoft Corp. to Spotify Technology SA have joined in complaining publicly about app marketplace practices. Last month, Facebook Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a webcast with employees that Apple has the ability to block innovation and ""to charge monopoly rents,"" according to a person familiar with the matter. Apple hasn't commented on Mr. Zuckerberg's remarks. In response to regulatory probes, Apple has denied hurting rivals and said it wants apps that compete with its services to thrive. In its filing Tuesday, Apple sought to portray itself as a victim of plotting by Epic. The tech giant described all the help it had given Epic in recent years and detailed how it alleged the game company had begun laying groundwork for what Apple called a ""calculated and pre-packaged campaign"" against it. ""Fortnite"" has been downloaded almost 130 million times since being added to the App Store in 2018, according to Apple. Epic has earned more than $600 million from its relationship with Apple, according to court records. Epic Chief Executive Tim Sweeney in late June emailed Apple executives, including CEO Tim Cook, asking for a special agreement exempting his company from existing contractual obligations, including the App Store payments, according to Apple's filing. The tech giant rejected that demand. Then on Aug. 3, Epic sent to the App Store an update of ""Fortnite"" that the game company described as a ""hotfix"" but that Apple claimed was a Trojan horse allowing it to bypass Apple's review process and payment system. At around 2 a.m. Aug. 3, Mr. Sweeney emailed Apple again. ""Epic will no longer adhere to Apple's payment processing restrictions,"" he wrote, according to the filing. Mr. Sweeney declined comment on Apple's latest filing. A few hours later, Apple said, Epic activated the external payment workaround that cut Apple out of its share of sales. ""Epic sought to enjoy all of the benefits of Apple's iOS platform and related services while its ""hotfix' lined Epic's pockets at Apple's expense,"" Apple said in its filing. That was followed by a public relations battle and lawsuit against Apple. Epic showed a video on ""Fortnite"" mimicking the iPhone-maker's '1984' ad campaign. Apple has defended its take of app purchases in the past as a way to help fund the development of its ecosystem that provides a safe and secure way to download third-party software. The company said in its filing that Apple requires every app on its system to undergo a ""rigorous, human-assisted review."" It noted that Epic has its own app marketplace where it charges a commission as well, though Epic takes only a 12% cut of sales. ""There is nothing anticompetitive about charging a commission for others to use one's service,"" Apple said in the filing. Epic said last week that it remains committed to the legal fight but that its business has been harmed in recent weeks. The company said daily active players using Apple's mobile operating system, or iOS, of ""Fortnite""—which Epic said has more than 350 million registered users—has plummeted since the dispute began and its reputation with consumers has been harmed. Though ""Fortnite"" can be played on mobile devices as well as gaming consoles and personal computers, Epic said iOS players represented the largest segment of users.

Apple,Markets Main,25 February 2019,The Wall Street Journal Online,991 words,0.9848,0.066,0.024,0.909,"Apple Inc. executives came to a group of big banks in 2017 with a problem. The technology giant had been relying on a patchwork of smaller banks to allow Apple's customers to lease iPhones, store cash in digital wallets and text money to friends. Apple wanted a new partner to rethink the business, according to people familiar with the process. Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and others pitched their services, the people said. Apple instead went with a name little known on Main Street: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The elite investment bank will soon roll out an Apple credit card that will sync with an iPhone app, The Wall Street Journal reported last week . The card is part of a broader partnership between Apple and Goldman to offer financial advice and products to millions of iPhone users. The collaboration will be closely watched by rivals in both Silicon Valley and Wall Street that are puzzling through the messy collision of finance and technology. The biggest banks, though wary of powerful tech companies, are also eager to not be left behind by them. Neither Apple nor Goldman has much experience in consumer finance. But Apple is a colossus, with billions in cash and cultish fans. Goldman has a $933 billion balance sheet and a willingness to take chances that rivals won't as it builds a retail-banking business from scratch. ""Now you've got a whole new competitor that's larger than anyone else in financial services"" in clout and global reach, said Mal Durkee, a former Merrill Lynch investment banker who has advised banks, regulators and financial-tech startups. ""It's game on."" Tech companies are venturing deeper into financial services, betting the combination of a loyal user base and trove of data can unlock new revenue opportunities. In just the U.S. credit-card and payments market, the annual revenue pool is roughly $500 billion, according to Bernstein Research. Financial regulations, though, mean they can't do it alone. They need banks, and that regulatory wrinkle is leading to unexpected partnerships between industry titans like Apple and Goldman, which typically prefer to operate alone. Other examples are sure to follow. Amazon.com Inc. last year talked to banks about building its own checking-account-like product, the Journal reported at the time . The strategy was a bet that people who shop on Amazon.com, get groceries at its Whole Foods stores and listen to Amazon's streaming music service on the company's Alexa devices might want to do their banking with the company, too. Tech companies both new and old are burrowing deeper into finance. Square Inc., the financial-technology firm known for its white credit-card readers that plug into smartphones, filed paperwork in December to open its own bank in Utah. Intuit Inc. offers loans to businesses that use its accounting software. ""People need to store money, move money and borrow money,"" said Frank Rotman, a venture capitalist at QED Investors and a former Capital One Financial Corp. executive. ""If there's a strategic rationale for a tech company to do any of those three things, they need to become a bank or partner with one."" Goldman can't do it on its own either. It is new to consumer banking, having spent most of its 150-year history catering to big companies and billionaires. Without branches, it needs other ways to find customers for its online savings and lending business. Apple, too, needs new engines of growth as iPhone sales slow . Its mobile-payment system, Apple Pay, has been slow to catch on in a crowded field. Only one-quarter of U.S. iPhone users have activated Apple Pay, and mobile payments accounted for an estimated 1% of the $39.75 billion in services revenue that Apple reported for its latest fiscal year, estimates Loup Ventures, an investment and research firm. Apple has been putting more of its resources toward financial services. Jennifer Bailey, the executive who is in charge of Apple Pay, was tasked with overhauling the company's fragmented banking relationships, which had become a point of frustration inside Apple, people familiar with the matter said. A regional bank in Rhode Island extended loans to U.S. customers buying the latest iPhone. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Barclays PLC offered similar loans in Britain. A third bank managed the cash that Apple Pay users kept in their accounts. And Apple's rewards credit card was issued by Barclays. In 2017, Apple sought to consolidate some of those relationships, people familiar with the matter said. Citigroup held detailed talks with Apple that year about a partnership, people familiar with the talks said. The companies discussed spinning technology used by Citigroup's consumer bank, which has 18 million digital users, into a new app, the people said. But Goldman won in part because it is a newcomer. It agreed to build features that Apple wanted because it doesn't have existing credit-card partners that might be angered, people familiar with the process said. ""Banks that are big in credit cards have all these existing relationships"" with airlines, retailers and other clients, said Scott Samlin, a lawyer at Pepper Hamilton LLP who advises banks. ""I'm sure there would be objections."" That Goldman has been Apple's investment bank of choice helped its case, too, the people said. Goldman led Apple's $17 billion bond sale in 2013, at the time the biggest corporate offering ever, and has advised Apple on deals. Apple's corporate-development team is stacked with Goldman alums, too. , Peter Rudegeair at Peter.Rudegeair@wsj.com and Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com (""mailto:Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com"")"
Apple,Markets,8 January 2018,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,244 words",0.9892,0.114,0.062,0.824,"The iPhone has made Apple Inc. and Wall Street hundreds of billions of dollars. Now some big shareholders are asking at what cost, in an unusual campaign to make the company more socially responsible. A leading activist investor and a pension fund are saying the smartphone maker needs to respond to what some see as a growing public-health crisis of youth phone addiction. Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, or Calstrs, which control about $2 billion of Apple shares, sent a letter to Apple on Saturday urging it to develop new software tools that would help parents control and limit phone use more easily and to study the impact of overuse on mental health. The Apple push is a preamble to a new several-billion-dollar fund Jana is seeking to raise this year to target companies it believes can be better corporate citizens. It is the first instance of a big Wall Street activist seeking to profit from the kind of social-responsibility campaign typically associated with a small fringe of investors. Adding splash, rock star Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler, will be on an advisory board along with Sister Patricia A. Daly, a nun who successfully fought Exxon Mobil Corp. over environmental disclosures, and Robert Eccles, an expert on sustainable investing. The Apple campaign would be unusual for an activist like Jana, which normally urges companies to make financial changes. But the investors believe that Apple's highflying stock could be hurt in coming decades if it faces a backlash and that proactive moves could generate goodwill and keep consumers loyal to Apple brands. ""Apple can play a defining role in signaling to the industry that paying special attention to the health and development of the next generation is both good business and the right thing to do,"" the shareholders wrote in the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. ""There is a developing consensus around the world including Silicon Valley that the potential long-term consequences of new technologies need to be factored in at the outset, and no company can outsource that responsibility."" Obsessive teenage smartphone usage has sparked a debate among academics, parents and even the people who helped create the iPhone. Some have raised concerns about increased rates in teen depression and suicide and worry that phones are replacing old-fashioned human interaction. It is part of a broader re-evaluation of the effects on society of technology companies such as Google and Amazon.com Inc. and social-media companies like Facebook Inc. and Snapchat owner Snap Inc., which are facing questions about their reach into everyday life. Apple hasn't offered any public guidance to parents on how to manage children's smartphone use or taken a position on at what age they should begin using iPhones. Apple and its rivals point to features that give parents some measure of control. Apple, for instance, gives parents the ability to choose which apps, content and services their children can access. The basic idea behind socially responsible investing is that good corporate citizenship can also be good business. Big investors and banks, including TPG, UBS Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are making bets on socially responsible companies, boosting what they see as good actors and avoiding bad ones. Big-name activists increasingly view bad environmental, social or governance policies as red flags. Jana plans to go further, putting its typical tools to work to drive change that may not immediately pay off. Apple is an ambitious first target: The combined Jana-Calstrs stake is relatively small given Apple's nearly $900 billion market value. Still, in recent years Apple has twice faced activists demanding it pare its cash holdings, and both times the company ceded some ground. Chief Executive Tim Cook has led Apple's efforts to be a more socially responsible company, for instance on environmental and immigration issues, and said in an interview with the New York Times last year that Apple has a ""moral responsibility"" to help the U.S. economy. Apple has shown willingness to use software to address potentially negative consequences of phone usage. Amid rising concerns about distracted driving, the company last year updated its software with a ""do not disturb while driving"" feature, which enables the iPhone to detect when someone is behind the wheel and automatically silence notifications. The iPhone is the backbone of a business that generated $48.35 billion in profit in fiscal 2017. It helped turn Apple into the world's largest publicly listed company by market value, and anticipation of strong sales of its latest model, the iPhone X, helped its stock rise 50% in the past year. Apple phones made up 43% of U.S. smartphones in use in 2016, according to comScore, and an estimated 86 million Americans over age 13 own an iPhone. Jana and Calstrs are working with Jean M. Twenge of San Diego State University, who chronicled the problem of what she has dubbed the ""iGen"" in a book that was previewed in a widely discussed article in the Atlantic magazine last fall, and with Michael Rich of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital, known as ""the mediatrician"" for his work on the impact of media on children. The investors believe both the content and the amount of time spent on phones need to be tailored to youths, and they are raising concern about the public-health effects of failing to act. They point to research from Ms. Twenge and others about a ""growing body of evidence"" of ""unintentional negative side effects,"" including studies showing concerns from teachers. That is one reason Calstrs was eager to support the campaign, according to the letter. The group wants Apple to help find solutions to questions like what is optimal usage and to be at the forefront of the industry's response—before regulators or consumers potentially force it to act. The investors say Apple should make it easier and more intuitive for parents to set up usage limits, which could head off any future moves to proscribe smartphones. The question is ""How can we apply the same kind of public-health science to this that we do to, say, nutrition?"" Dr. Rich said in an interview. ""We aren't going to tell you never go to Mickey D's, but we are going to tell you what a Big Mac will do and what broccoli will do.""

Apple,Apple Shares Pull Down U.S. Stock Indexes,2 November 2018,Dow Jones Institutional News,892 words,0.9956,0.146,0.085,0.769,"English , Inc. A big drop in shares of Apple dragged major U.S. stock indexes into the red Friday, breaking their three-session winning streak. The iPhone maker's shares lost $14.74, or 6.6%, to $207.48 -- their biggest one-day percentage loss since January 2014 -- after the company gave disappointing guidance for the holiday quarter. The declines threatened to push the company's market value below $1 trillion and also spread to other big tech stocks, which had been hammered in October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 109.91 points, or 0.4%, to 25270.83, with Apple taking about 100 points off the index. The S&P 500 shed 0.6%, led by the tech sector, which slumped 1.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite posted the steepest declines, down 1%. Apple's results, released after the close of trading Thursday, showed the world's most valuable company turned in another period of record revenue and profit -- its fourth-consecutive quarter doing so. But investors seized on two points: Apple's revenue forecast didn't portend explosive growth, and the company said it would stop reporting unit-sales figures for its three most recognizable brands, the iPhone, iPad and Mac. Based on Apple's current reported share count, its valuation would fall under a trillion if its stock fell below $207.04. That could change when Apple reports a new share count in its quarterly filing with securities regulators. Apple's declines spread to the rest of the tech sector Friday. Netflix and Intel fell more than 2%; Google parent Alphabet dropped more than 1%; and Facebook shares declined 0.9%. Friday's slump underscored the fragility of the U.S. stock market's recent rebound. After a crushing October that shaved more than $4.5 trillion from shares of companies in the U.S., Europe and Asia, the S&P 500 had risen more than 1% each of the past three trading sessions entering Friday. The index still ended the week up more than 2%, its best performance since March. Apple's fall exemplifies how during this earnings season, companies are getting atypically punished for disappointing quarterly results and poor guidance. ""Even though revenue and earnings numbers may be good, a lot of those eye-popping growth numbers are already known and expected this quarter,"" said Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer of wealth and investment management for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""Companies with weaker guidance are seeing the most acute selling in their share prices."" Meanwhile, renewed hopes that trade tensions between the U.S. and China are de-escalating and a strong October jobs report had seemed to set up trading for another strong session, before Apple's losses pushed the indexes negative. Thursday's tweet from President Trump about what he called a ""long and very good conversation"" with his counterpart in China, Xi Jinping spurred optimism. ""While we are still cautious over a full resolution of recent tensions in the medium term, resumption of dialogue between Washington and Beijing would be good enough to investors for now,"" said Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. And the October jobs report buttressed the argument that the U.S. economy remains on strong footing, as the Labor Department reported that hiring accelerated last month and the unemployment rate held at a 49-year low. Wages increased 3.1% from a year earlier, the best year-over-year gain for average hourly earnings since 2009, data showed. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 3.214% versus 3.144% on Thursday. Yields move inversely to prices. The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, slipped less than 0.1%, paring declines after the jobs report. But what is good for the economy doesn't always translate to positive news for stock investors, as many worry that rises in wages could hurt corporate profit margins and lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly. Still, even as wages rose, which tends to be a sign of inflation, bond-proxies such as utilities, consumer staples and real-estate stocks declined Friday. Even after weeks of battering, Mr. Cronk at Wells Fargo Investment Institute said he wasn't ready to recommend investors buy up more shares of tech stocks, saying he didn't believe prices have come down enough to make the group compelling. Instead, he is recommending clients scoop up shares of industrial and financial companies, which he finds ""unduly cheap"" right now based in part on their price-to-earnings ratios. Stocks across Europe also advanced, with the Stoxx Europe 600 up 0.3%, following larger rises in Asia. Meanwhile, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rose 2.6%, China's Shenzhen A Share Index gained 3.4% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rallied 4.2%. Sarah E.

Apple,*Apple Is Manufacturing Its New Mac Pro Computer in China,28 June 2019,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,185 words",0.9351,0.034,0.016,0.95,"English , Inc. 28 Jun 2019 *Apple's Mac Pro Was Company's Only Major Device Assembled in the U.S. 28 Jun 2019 *Apple's Reliance on Factories in China Has Been an Issue Under President Trump 28 Jun 2019 Apple Moves Mac Pro Production to China By Tripp Mickle and Yoko Kubota Apple Inc. is manufacturing its new Mac Pro computer in China, according to people familiar with its plans, shifting abroad production of what had been its only major device assembled in the U.S. as trade tensions escalate between the Trump administration and Beijing. The tech giant has tapped contractor Quanta Computer Inc. to manufacture the $6,000 desktop computer and is ramping up production at a factory near Shanghai, the people said. Quanta's facility is close to other Apple suppliers across Asia, making it possible for Apple to achieve lower shipping costs than if it shipped components to the U.S. While the Mac Pro isn't one of Apple's bigger products, the decision on where to make it carries outsize significance. Apple's reliance on factories in China to manufacture its products has been an issue for the company, especially under President Trump, who has pressured Apple and other companies to make more in the U.S. With the previous Mac Pro model, released in 2013, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook trumpeted plans to build it in the U.S. Apple invested $100 million in tooling and other equipment for a plant in Austin, Texas, run by contract manufacturer Flex Ltd. Each computer was stamped with ""Assembled in the USA."" Flex and Quanta declined to comment. An Apple spokesman said the new Mac Pro is designed and engineered in the U.S. and includes U.S.-made components. Apple said it supports manufacturing in 30 U.S. states and spent $60 billion last year with more than 9,000 U.S. suppliers. ""Final assembly is only one part of the manufacturing process,"" the spokesman said, adding that the company's investments support two million American jobs. The Mac Pro is Apple's most powerful computer, used primarily by a small group of professionals working in industries such as film and videogames. President Trump has pressured Apple to make some iPhones, Macs or iPads in the U.S. since the 2016 presidential campaign. He told The Wall Street Journal in 2017 that Mr. Cook promised to build ""three big plants, beautiful plants"" in the U.S., a claim Apple declined to comment on at the time. Last year, as his administration imposed tariffs on imports from China, Mr. Trump said the only way to ensure prices for Apple goods don't increase would be to make products in the U.S. Apple in the past two years has announced a second campus in Austin, Texas, to handle customer support and operations, and announced more than $500 million in new contracts with U.S. component suppliers that manufacture at home. But Apple hasn't disclosed any plans to build new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Making the new model in China isn't likely to affect many workers in Texas because demand for the old Mac Pro had fizzled years ago. The Flex workforce had shifted to refurbishing already-made computers, former Flex employees said. The Flex plant continues to make products for HP Inc. and other companies, they said. Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, looking to revive trade talks, are scheduled to meet for lunch Saturday at the Group of 20 meeting in Osaka, Japan. Last year, the Trump administration spared product categories including Apple's smartwatch and AirPods wireless earbuds from an initial round of duties. But the administration's proposal to impose additional tariffs of 25% covering $300 billion in imports from China would affect all of Apple's major devices, including the Mac, iPhone and iPad. While it shifts Mac Pro production to China, Apple more broadly also is considering moving some of its assembly work out of China because of concerns about U.S. tariffs, The Wall Street Journal reported last week. One of the people familiar with Mac Pro plans said that same consideration also could extend to the Mac Pro, with Ireland as an alternate possible site. The Mac Pro's history reflects the hurdles to doing assembly in the U.S. The previous Mac Pro model -- known as the ""trash can"" because of its stumpy, cylindrical appearance--was the first computer Apple had made in the U.S. in about a decade. Mr. Cook, who had architected Apple's outsourcing to China, announced plans to build the product in the U.S. in late 2012, when Apple was facing major scrutiny over its reliance on manufacturers in China and those contractors' treatment of workers. Flex secured a designation as a Texas Enterprise Zone project at the time of the initiative, entitling it to $250,000 in annual tax breaks in support of $15 million in equipment purchases and 500 jobs with an average annual wage of $30,276, according to the state. The designation expires this month. Almost immediately, Apple ran into challenges at the Flex plant in Austin, former Apple employees said. More than 80% of the workers working across three assembly lines were contract employees paid minimum wage for eight-hour workdays, said Alan Hanrahan, a former Apple manufacturing supervisor, in an interview with the Journal two years ago. When their shift ended, many walked off the job, he said -- even if the lines were still running. Production would stop, and people would just be standing there until the next person arrived and the shift could resume, he said. As demand for the Mac Pro tapered, Flex began laying people off, several former Flex employees said. By last year, they were down to a skeleton crew working just a quarter of one of the assembly lines and refurbishing already-made Mac Pros, said Jeff Gruger, a former vice president of product at Flex. ""They learned it's very difficult to manufacture in America,"" Mr. Hanrahan said of Apple in the 2017 interview. Apple this year overhauled the Mac Pro to give it more power and a radically different silver, rectangular design. The design could be one of the last developed under the leadership of design chief Jony Ive, who Apple announced Thursday will leave the company later this year. Manufacturing labor costs in China, though rising, still remain much lower than in the U.S., said Paul Gagnon, a consumer-electronics analyst with IHS Markit. Taiwan-based Quanta has made MacBooks and Apple's smartwatch for years. In addition to four facilities in China, it has a small facility in Fremont, Calif., where it works on custom desktops, according to one of the people familiar with its plans. and Yoko Kubota at yoko.kubota@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires June 28, 2019 (13:30 GMT)"
Apple,Markets,2 August 2018,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,286 words",0.9933,0.119,0.053,0.828,"Apple Inc. on Thursday became the first U.S. company to surpass $1 trillion in market value, underscoring the iPhone maker's explosive growth and its role in the technology industry's ascent to the forefront of the global economy and markets. Shares of the world's most valuable public company rose $5.89, or 2.9%, to $207.39, making it worth slightly more than $1 trillion. Apple reached the milestone when it climbed above $207.04 in midday trading. The stock has risen 23% so far this year, its latest rally coming after it reported strong revenue and profit gains Tuesday as demand for high-price iPhones remained resilient and sales from the app store and other services hit all-time highs. Apple's rise has been propelled by the sustained success of the iPhone developed under late co-founder Steve Jobs, a product visionary who helped revive the company from a death spiral in the late 1990s. His successor, Tim Cook, has turned Apple into a cash-generating giant by pushing its existing products to prominence in China and cultivating its rapidly growing services business—moves that have helped stave off concerns about the absence of a new, blockbuster device. ""We've heard a number of times since Mr. Jobs died that the company was going to slip and fall, but they've continued to execute,"" said Greg Hersch, founder of New York City-based Florence Capital Advisors, which has more than $400 million under management and counts Apple among its largest holdings. Along the way, Apple has led a broader tech boom that has made a handful of giant companies central in people's daily lives and investment portfolios. The five most valuable companies—Apple, Amazon.com Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Facebook Inc.—are all tech and internet firms, a level of industry dominance rare in recent markets history. Those five collectively accounted for nearly 15% of the total value of the S&P 500 as of last month, according to Ned Davis Research. The iPhone, and the smartphone era it birthed, helped lift other tech giants—and disrupted many other businesses. Smartphones drive mobile advertising businesses at Google and Facebook, and account for an increasing share of the e-commerce transactions lifting Amazon. Technology's ubiquity, and the industry's swelling wealth and clout, also have triggered growing criticism and regulatory scrutiny—one of several factors that could undermine the boom. This year, Apple confronted investor pressure to address the public health risks of rising youth smartphone addiction. Facebook and Google were grilled by U.S. lawmakers over data privacy. Amazon's business practices were slammed by President Donald Trump. Some money managers worry that a few highflying firms are powering the broader market, leaving stocks susceptible to a painful downturn if the rally ends. Apple, founded as an upstart maker of personal computers in 1976, first took the crown as the largest company in August 2011 when it edged out Exxon Mobil Corp., signifying tech's displacement of energy as market king. At the time, Apple was valued at roughly $343 billion. Mr. Jobs died a few months later, having transformed the company from a niche computer company to a global electronics powerhouse. But Apple kept rising, cementing its market-cap lead in August 2013 and holding it consistently since then except for a few days in 2016 when Alphabet was bigger. More recently, Apple has had to hold off Amazon, which was worth just a third of Apple's value in 2011 but whose stock recently has surged as it shows it can grow profit as well as sales. Amazon was worth about $890 billion on Thursday, and Alphabet was worth about $860 billion. Microsoft, at more than $825 billion, isn't far behind. The calculation of Apple's market value is based on the company's share count as of July 20. Share counts fluctuate day by day based on factors like stock buybacks, but generally aren't disclosed more than a few times a year. Apple isn't the world's first company to claim the $1 trillion title. In 2007, PetroChina Co.'s market cap surpassed that level by some measures, though the Chinese oil and gas producer's corporate structure kept most of its shares locked up in government hands, making it difficult to determine the firm's actual value. Outside of the public markets, there is Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the state-owned oil company. It weighed an initial public offering that could value the business at as much as $2 trillion. The plan has stalled however, and the actual value of the company, known as Saudi Aramco, isn't clear. Apple's ascent is especially remarkable since its survival as a company was in doubt just over two decades ago. It lost $2 billion over two years in the mid-1990s, weighed a sale to Sun Microsystems, and churned through three CEOs in four years before bringing back Mr. Jobs. He revived the business by thinning Apple's product lineup and spearheading a trio of hits: the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Mr. Cook, who took over in 2011, broadened the iPhone's reach, helping it become one of the best-selling products in history, with more than 1.4 billion devices sold. Huge numbers were sold in China, a market that exploded in 2015 after Apple signed a deal with the largest mobile operator. China now accounts for a fifth of Apple's sales. The iPhone also underpinned Apple's services sales, which Mr. Cook set the goal of doubling in four years to $50 billion by 2020. On Tuesday, he said Apple is on track to hit that goal thanks to accelerating subscription sales, growing transactions on Apple Pay and other factors. The iPhone X, which launched last November, has delivered minimal unit growth, but its $999 price tag has lifted total sales by raising average iPhone selling prices 15% higher to $750 in the nine months ended in June. In May, Apple announced it would add $100 billion in share repurchases, the largest ever announced by a company. Unlike some peers that trade at lofty multiples, Apple is still relatively cheap based on its current performance. Some investors worry about the escalating trade dispute between the U.S. and China however. Apple acknowledged this week that those tensions could increase its manufacturing costs and dampen product sales. In the longer term, investors worry about Apple's ability to launch another transformational product like the iPhone. Its smartwatch, which debuted in 2015, made Apple the world's largest watch company by sales but hasn't delivered the same type of boost that other hit products have. ""One of the things that has always concerned us is the concentration in the iPhone,"" said Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners, which owns the stock. ""But I don't think there is a risk that there is some gee-whiz product in the next 12 to 24 months that is going to unseat the iPhone as the king."" and Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com More * Warren Buffett Leads Parade of Apple Winners * Heard on the Street: Big Tech's Path to $4 Trillion * Why It's Tricky to Peg Just When Apple Hit the $1 Trillion Milestone * Apple's iPhones Power Quarterly Earnings * FANG-Stock Stories Have Bite * Heard on the Street: Apple Could've Been a Trillionaire Long Ago(""https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-couldve-been-a-trillionaire-long-ago-1533031200"")"
Apple,The Bull Case and the Bear Case on Apple Stock -- Barrons.com,12 June 2019,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,103 words",0.985,0.103,0.063,0.834,"English , Inc. Apple has been one of the most important stock stories of 2019 -- and its easy to see why. It's one of the world's biggest companies, widely held, and a useful window into global trade, technological trends, and the direction of the market itself. All that has occasionally led Apple to resemble a volatile trading stock. From September 2018 highs above $230 through early January, Apple stock (ticker: AAPL) had tumbled 40% near the halfway point . The stock gained much of that back by early May before trade worries caused the stock to fall again. The stock, trading at about $195 in mid-June, is up about 23% in 2019, ahead of the S&P 500. Strong convictions from bulls and bears have contributed to the volatility. Here's the bull case and the bear case on Apple stock. The bear case on Apple stock: iPhone saturation, a struggle in services, and CEO Tim Cook -- Have we reached peak iPhone? If you're down on Apple stock, you likely think so. Sales of iPhones have flatlined, and Apple recently stopped disclosing the number of phones sold. That has some investors assuming the worst. Wall Street estimates that Apple will sell 142 million iPhones in 2019, down from 167 million the year before, and in line with the number sold in 2017. Apple has managed to push up the price of the average iPhone sold, from $652 in 2017 to an estimated $768. But that, predictably, has hurt demand. It's unclear whether the next generation of iPhones, due in the fall, could re-energize demand. Wall Street isn't expecting much, as analysts see essentially flat iPhone unit sales in 2020, as well. -- The outlook for iPhone sales could be complicated by ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. If tariffs expand to more goods -- as threatened by President Donald Trump -- iPhones could fall under a 25% tariff. That would leave Apple with a difficult choice: raise prices and risk losing sales, or eat the tariffs and accept narrower margins. Protracted trade tensions with China could also hurt demand for Apple products in China, some analysts suggest. And looking up the supply chain, there is risk to the supply of raw materials Apple and other tech companies use. -- Apple hopes its services business will more than pick up the iPhone slack. The company recently launched a paid subscription news service and has plans for streaming video and videogames next. That builds on Apple Music, AppleCare, and iCloud. The competition in those markets, however -- including Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Netflix (NFLX) -- is well-heeled and already established. Legal challenges to the fees Apple charges in its App Store may also endanger future profits, though those challenges may take years to resolve. (Were the App Store matter to lead to an antitrust case against Apple, that could further weigh on the shares, though some analysts appear bullish on a breakup.) In any case, for Apple bears, services can't make up for the flagging iPhone. ""Efficient group communication around services cannot compensate for the reality of a shrinking core iPhone product,"" HSBC's Erwan Rambourg wrote in May. -- Finally, there's Tim Cook -- the CEO who, bears like to point out, isn't Steve Jobs. Critics think Cook isn't the right person to maintain the company's place as a leader in innovation. They're hoping for more dramatic moves, perhaps including a major acquisition, that could quickly open up a product line. ( A videogame studio is sometimes discussed as a possibility, though so is Tesla.) But while investors have been asking ""who's next?"" for some time, a few are ready for change now. ""Current management is better suited to operations and methodic execution than producing visionary new product and opening new categories,"" Chatham Road Partners' Colin Gillis wrote in April. The bull case on Apple stock: An 'ecosystem' that will drive services growth -- Slower iPhone growth may not be the nightmare it appears, Apple bulls suggest, because the size of the installed base will eventually pay off when it comes time to upgrade. Many analysts think 5G networks will drive even further upgrades. All that could lead to stronger streams of services revenue. ""We believe Apple's ecosystem approach, including an [installed] base which now exceeds 1.4 billion devices globally is leading to record services revenue, and we expect the higher-margin services revenue growth to continue outpacing total company growth."" Canaccord Genuity's Michael Walkley wrote in early May. Services revenue was $37.2 billion for the fiscal year that ended in September 2018. That's still a fraction of Apple's $257 billion in total sales last year. Wall Street, however, expects services to top $80 billion by 2022, growing to more than half of gross profits by that time, according to FactSet. -- Apple has grown several product categories into major businesses. AirPods have gone from curiosity to mainstream; the latest iPads are well-reviewed; and the Apple Watch jump-started the growth of the wearables category. Virtual and augmented reality, as well as innovation in the health care space -- particularly through the Apple Watch -- could keep that rolling, a likelihood investors may be undervaluing. ""When the iPhone (once in a generation product) becomes the basis of comparison, everything else, however successful, looks incremental,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in May. -- Apple has committed itself to shareholder return through continued dividends and stock buybacks. Its massive cash hoard -- approaching $40 billion recently -- and free cash flow generation gives it wide leeway to invest in growth, while also rewarding shareholders. -- Meanwhile, It's hard to argue with Cook's success. Since he took over in mid-2011, Apple stock is up some 260%, well ahead of the S&P 500. Apple stock by the numbers Apple stock is up about 2% over the last 12 months, a bit behind the S&P 500. It's currently trading at about 16 times estimated earnings for the next 12 months, a slightly premium to its five-year average of 13.6 times. Wall Street's average price target on Apple shares is around $210, according to FactSet, with the average rating a Buy. Analysts' price targets range from $150 to $245.

Apple,"Apple to Pay $38 Billion in Taxes on Cash Overseas, Build U.S. Campus",17 January 2018,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,420 words",0.9897,0.078,0.029,0.892,"English , Inc. Apple Inc. said it would pay a one-time tax of $38 billion on its overseas cash holdings and ramp up spending in the U.S., as it seeks to emphasize its contributions to the American economy after years of taking criticism for outsourcing manufacturing to China. The world’s most valuable publicly traded company laid out its plans Wednesday in a statement that was full of big-dollar figures, though it said that much of the money reflected Apple’s current pace of spending. Apple said it would invest $30 billion in capital spending in the U.S. over five years that would create more than 20,000 jobs. The total includes a new campus, which initially will house technical support for customers, and $10 billion toward data centers across the country. It also will expand from $1 billion to $5 billion a fund it established last year for investing in advanced manufacturing in the U.S. Apple’s $38 billion tax commitment is the largest such sum announced in response to the major overhaul of the U.S. tax code that President Donald Trump signed into law late last year. That law included an incentive for U.S. companies to bring home offshore holdings, with companies required to pay a one-time tax of 15.5% on overseas profits held in cash and other liquid assets. U.S. companies have long pushed for such a change to enable them to repatriate overseas cash without what they considered an excessive tax hit. Apple on Wednesday cited the tax changes as the reason for its $38 billion payment. It didn’t say how much of its $252.3 billion in overseas cash holdings it plans to bring home, though it will be the vast majority, Chief Executive Tim Cook told ABC News in an interview. All told, Apple said it would directly contribute $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next five years, with the bulk—about $55 billion this year, for example—coming from ongoing spending on parts and services from U.S. suppliers. That number also includes the federal tax payment and capital spending. Mr. Cook touted the plans as building on Apple’s support for the U.S. economy. “We have a deep sense of responsibility to give back to our country and the people who help make our success possible,” he said in a statement. The company said in November that it had earmarked $36 billion to cover deferred taxes on that money, assuming that it would eventually pay U.S. taxes on a portion of it by bringing it home. Mr. Trumppraised Apple’s announcement on Twitter, saying his policies allowed the tech giant “to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States.” He added, “Huge win for American workers and the USA!” Apple didn’t provide historical comparisons for some of the figures it gave Wednesday. The company previously said it planned $16 billion in capital expenditures world-wide in the fiscal year that ends this September, up from $14.9 billion the previous year. However, Apple doesn’t break out its spending in the U.S., making it difficult to gauge how much of the $30 billion over five years it announced Wednesday is new. Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said Apple’s plans are in line with Trump administration goals, but it isn’t clear how many of the commitments are new. And he said the company could deliver on those commitments with existing cash flow—without needing to tap cash holdings. “It’s a nice number and puts a foot forward in line with where the administration wants to go with adding jobs and building in the U.S.,” he said. But “it’s not clear these investments were impacted in any way by tax reform.” Apple has faced criticism over the past decade for overseas manufacturing of its iPhones, of which it has sold more than one billion, rather than making them domestically. Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign blasted the company for outsourcing. He later called on Apple to build a factory in the U.S. and last year said Mr. Cook promised to build three plants in the U.S. Apple also has been the poster child for parking overseas profits offshore, and U.S. lawmakers and others have claimed the company sought to avoid U.S. and international taxes—a criticism Apple has strongly rejected. Apple has responded over the past year by pointing to its spending on procurement in the U.S. and to the size of the so-called app economy spawned by the iPhone, which the company says has created more than 1.6 million U.S. jobs. The tax overhaul’s one-time levy on overseas cash is often referred to as a repatriation tax, although it applies whether companies leave their foreign profits overseas or bring them to the U.S. It is intended as a transition from the previous tax system, under which the U.S. taxed all world-wide profits of an American company except those kept overseas, to the new system, in which the U.S. won’t tax most foreign profits at all. Companies may choose to pay the one-time tax over eight years. The $38 billion in taxes Apple owes reflects its growth in the decade since Congress last reduced taxes on overseas holdings. In 2006, Apple recorded a tax charge of $51 million as it repatriated $1.6 billion in cash held overseas for the fiscal year. Apple’s accumulated foreign profits of $252.3 billion amount to just over a quarter of the U.S. tech industry’s total, a Wall Street Journal analysis of 311 large public companies found, and about 9.5% of the $2.65 trillion in foreign profits reported by all companies in the analysis. A tax obligation of $38 billion would work out to about 15% of the S&P 500’s total obligation under the repatriation tax, based on figures from the Journal analysis and a separate analysis by Zion Research Group. Altogether, the Joint Tax Committee estimated last month, the tax should raise about $339 billion over 10 years from all companies—meaning Apple could account for 11% of the total. The changes in U.S. tax law triggering Apple’s $38 billion tax obligation don’t affect the company’s responsibility to repay Ireland €13 billion ($15.9 billion) in unpaid taxes in Europe, according to a spokesman for Ireland’s Department of Finance. Apple has challenged the ruling. Apple also told employees Wednesday it is issuing each of them a bonus of $2,500 in restricted stock, according to a person familiar with the matter. The planned bonus, reported earlier by Bloomberg, adds Apple to the growing list of companies that are rewarding employees due to the new tax law, including AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. If Apple brings home a large share of its overseas cash it could decide to apply some of it to more buybacks and dividends. Apple has returned $233.9 billion to investors since fiscal 2012. Mr. Sacconaghi expects Apple to provide an update on potential increases to those programs when it reports quarterly results in April or May, when it typically announces such plans. That would give it a chance to see how much cash other companies plan to return to shareholders from overseas holdings—moves that could please investors but aren’t as helpful to public perception as investments in jobs. “No company with that much cash wants to be the first to do a significant buyback,” he said. Apple’s announcement said it currently employs 84,000 people in the U.S., 4,000 more than it said a year ago. The company said it would offer more information later this year on its planned new campus. The facility is expected to be located outside of California and Texas, where the company already operates campuses: in Austin, Texas, and its new $5 billion headquarters, Apple Park, in Cupertino, Calif. Corrections & Amplifications Apple had $252.3 billion in cash and marketable securities held overseas as of the end of November. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated it had $246 billion overseas. (END) Dow Jones Newswires January 17, 2018 (19:00 GMT)"

The court's decision came on a day when Apple shares already were trading sharply lower because of rising U.S.-China trade tensions. Apple assembles most of its devices in China and counts on China for about a fifth of its sales. As of mid-morning Monday, Apple's stock price was down about 4.5%, while the broader market had declined about 2%. More broadly, Monday's decision could open the door to additional consumer lawsuits against other tech companies that run marketplaces on their platforms. App-store sales account for about 35% of Apple' ballooning services business. Apple has pointed to that business as a bright spot in the face of declines in the number of iPhones sold. The services business grew by about 30% during last fiscal year to $39.75 billion. The App Store offers developers access to 900 million iPhones world-wide and generally reaches a more affluent audience than rivals. Users of iPhones and iPads spent an estimated $46.6 billion on apps in 2018, almost double what was spent for apps from rival service Google Play, according to Sensor Tower, a market research firm. Apple said last year it had paid developers more than $100 billion from app sales over the past decade. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple has said it is entitled to take a share of app sales because it built the store and employs staff who review 100,000 submissions weekly for compliance with its rules around privacy and content. The Apple tax, as some developers have called it, has faced criticism for years. In addition to the litigation on app sales, separately the iPhone maker is facing pushback on how it handles in-app subscription services. In 2015, Spotify Technology SA began encouraging users to stop subscribing through Apple by raising monthly pricing to $13 in the App Store compared with $10 through the music service's website. Lately, Netflix Inc. and Fortnite creator Epic Games have moved to avoid Apple's fees by offering their products outside the App Store. Apple's rules differ somewhat from those of Alphabet Inc.'s Google, which developed the Android phone operating system. Google also takes a 30% cut of apps sold in its Google Play store, but Android phone can buy apps elsewhere, including directly from the software maker in some cases. and Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires May 13, 2019 (14:58 GMT)"
Apple,Apple Faces Two EU Antitrust Probes Over Apps -- 3rd Update,16 June 2020,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,347 words",-0.9901,0.065,0.108,0.827,"English , Inc. BRUSSELS -- European Union antitrust authorities launched two formal probes into whether Apple Inc. violated competition laws through its Apple Pay service and App Store, escalating the bloc's broader campaign to curb Silicon Valley giants' alleged attempts to corner markets and squash rivals. The EU's new investigations join other formal and informal probes into companies including Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., which is set to face EU antitrust charges in coming weeks. If found guilty, Apple could face a fine of up to 10% of its annual revenue and be forced to adjust its business practices.

The EU's new investigations join other formal and informal probes into companies including Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., which is set to face EU antitrust charges in coming weeks. In many of the cases, tech companies are accused of abusing a dual role as the operator of a marketplace and as a business that competes in that marketplace. If found guilty, Apple could face a fine of up to 10% of its annual revenue and be forced to adjust its business practices.

Apple,*Apple Music Adding U.S. Subscriber Accounts Faster than Spotify -- Sources,4 February 2018,Dow Jones Institutional News,"2,033 words",0.9949,0.091,0.03,0.878,"English , Inc. 4 Feb 2018 *Apple Music on Pace to Pass Spotify in U.S. Subscriptions This Summer -- Sources 4 Feb 2018 *Apple Music Now Has 36 Million Subscribers Globally -- Company 4 Feb 2018 Apple Music on Track to Overtake Spotify in U.S. Subscribers, Sources Say By Anne Steele Months before its hotly anticipated public stock offering, Spotify AB's lead in music streaming is shrinking, at least in the U.S. Apple Inc.'s Apple Music is adding subscriber accounts in the U.S. at a higher rate than Spotify, and is on track to pass the No. 1 streaming service this summer, according to people in the record business familiar with figures reported by the two services. Spotify is widely considered the dominant force in the streaming world, with Apple at a distant second. To be sure, Spotify is larger globally and continues to grow slightly faster. But that the No. 2 streaming service is quietly gaining ground in the largest music-subscription market in the world signals Spotify now has significant competition. The introduction of streaming services has fueled a recovery for the record industry following years of declines amid plummeting sales of CDs and, more recently, downloads. Streaming customers pay a flat monthly fee or listen to ads in exchange for unlimited access to vast music catalogs; with downloads, consumers pay for individual songs or albums once and own them permanently. Paid subscriptions, up 61%, were the largest source of record-company revenue in the U.S. in the first half of 2017, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. But music streaming has yet to prove itself as a viable business as the tech companies operating these services struggle to make them profitable. Active users and paid subscribers are the most closely watched metrics as these services grow. Apple's subscriber-account base in the U.S. has been growing about 5% monthly, versus Spotify's 2% clip, according to the people familiar with the numbers. Assuming those growth rates continue, Apple will overtake Spotify in accounts this summer. Apple's popular devices have helped add subscribers to its music service, which is preloaded on all iPhones, Apple Watches and other hardware the company sells. One question lingering in the industry is what metrics Spotify will have to disclose once it becomes a publicly traded company. The service has periodically released global subscriber totals and just last month touted a new high of 70 million. Apple Music told The Wall Street Journal it now has 36 million, up from the 30 million it last reported in September. But both companies' numbers are increased by counting individual users who are part of family plans and people with discounted subscriptions bundled with other services. In some countries, mobile-phone plans can include an Apple Music subscription; Spotify offers students in the U.S. a subscription plan that includes video-service Hulu. Neither company publicly breaks out figures for the U.S. or any other single market. In their licensing deals, labels let streaming services pay lower royalty rates for music when they meet certain subscription-growth targets. As part of those deals, the services are required to report how many accounts they have -- a number not inflated by multiple users on a family subscription. They also have to report the number of monthly active subscribers they have, stripping out people who were signed up in bundle deals but don't use the service and are likely to churn. By one standard, Apple Music has already passed Spotify. Including people who are still in free or deeply discounted trial periods leading up to paid subscription, Apple Music has a slight edge on Spotify in the U.S., according to one of the people familiar with the figures. Apple Music has three to four times the number of such trial users as Spotify, according to this person, in part because it doesn't offer a free tier. Also, all Apple Music subscribers are entered automatically into a free initial three-month period. Excluding those trial users, Spotify is ahead, but by a small amount -- and that gap is closing. Apple's services segment, which includes Apple Music as well as the App Store and its payment services, was a bright spot in the company's earnings posted last week, with an 18% jump in revenue. It is unclear how much Apple Music contributed to that increase as the company doesn't break out the streaming service's results. Launched in 2008, Spotify lets users listen to a library of more than 30 million songs on demand. It started offering its service in the U.S. in 2011. Subscribers who shell out $9.99 a month can listen without hearing ads; users of the free version need to sit through ads and have more limited ability to pick the order in which they hear the songs they select. As of June, Spotify said it has 140 million active users world-wide. Spotify has never reported a profit, but has said it believes it can become profitable once it has amassed sufficient users, without specifying what that scale would be. Apple Music, introduced in June 2015, allows users to stream from a catalog of 45 million songs or play from their own iTunes library. It has only ever offered an individual $9.99-a-month subscription tier. Both Spotify and Apple Music offer $4.99-a-month student plans and $14.99-a-month family plans, which up to six individuals can use. Spotify is available in 61 territories, including the U.S. Apple Music is available in 115. Next week, Apple will begin selling its voice-activated speaker, HomePod, which the tech giant has tried to differentiate from competitors' earlier offerings by promising better sound quality. The device has been marketed as a way to listen to Apple Music, which it will play directly; other music-streaming services can be played only over Apple's AirPlay. The introduction of the HomePod has the potential to boost Apple Music subscriptions. 4 Feb 2018 Apple Music on Track to Overtake Spotify in U.S. Subscribers, Sources Say By Anne Steele Apple Music is on the verge of overtaking Spotify AB in U.S. paid subscribers, a sign that the music-streaming world's dominant force is facing growing competition ahead of its hotly anticipated public stock offering. Apple Inc.'s streaming-music service, introduced in June 2015, has been adding subscribers in the U.S. more rapidly than its older Swedish rival -- a monthly growth rate of 5% versus 2% -- according to people in the record business familiar with figures reported by the two services. Assuming that clip continues, Apple will overtake Spotify in the world's biggest music market this summer. Apple's music-streaming service has been quietly gaining ground in part thanks to the popularity of the company's devices: Apple Music comes preloaded on all iPhones, Apple Watches and other hardware the company sells. Globally, however, Spotify remains in a league of its own, with nearly twice as many paid subscribers than No. 2 Apple, and slightly faster subscriber growth. Other players in paid streaming music include Pandora Media Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet's YouTube.

Apple,Apple and Qualcomm Agree to Drop All Litigation -- 2nd Update,16 April 2019,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,953 words",-0.8428,0.071,0.081,0.849,"English , Inc. BREAKING: * Qualcomm and Apple Agree to Drop All Litigation * Apple, Qualcomm Reached Global Patent License Agreement and Chipset Supply Agreement * Apple, Qualcomm Pact Also Ends All Ongoing Litigation With Apple's Contract Manufacturers (Article below will update.) SAN DIEGO -- Apple Inc. accused Qualcomm Inc. of forcing customers to pay twice to gain access to its chips, as trial arguments got under way in a long-brewing legal battle between the tech giants over how royalties are collected on innovations in smartphone technology. During opening remarks in front of a nine-person jury about 15 miles from Qualcomm headquarters, Apple's lawyers sought to portray the chip company as a monopolist that has used its patent portfolio to charge onerous licensing fees of 5% of the sales price of iPhones sold world-wide, capped at $400. They also have said the chip company blocked Apple for years from using another supplier of modem chips. ""Qualcomm has used their market power to set unfair prices to stifle competition and to dictate terms to some of the most powerful companies in the world,"" said attorney Ruffin Cordell of Fish & Richardson, which is representing Apple. ""This case is about things we all know are wrong."" To press his case, he turned to the business of fried chicken. He compared Qualcomm's licensing practices to someone showing up at a KFC restaurant to order chicken but being told to get an ""eating license"" from the fast-food chain first, because the chicken includes Colonel Sanders's secret recipe. Imagine, he said, the license cost $17 and the bucket of chicken costs $17. Mr. Cordell said Apple paid $16.1 billion for chips from 2010 to 2016, but that the ""eating-fee license"" it also had to pay to get any chips was $7.23 billion. ""Apple was having to double pay for these chips over and over and over again,"" he said. Qualcomm's opening arguments will follow. Its attorneys are likely to paint Apple as a bully responding to a slowdown in its core iPhone business by forcing Qualcomm to accept less money than it deserves for its contributions to the smartphone era. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf are expected to amplify those messages when they take the stand in coming weeks, a testament to the chasm between the companies' competing viewpoints on the value of smartphone innovations. At stake is the future of Qualcomm's business. An unfavorable ruling could force it to overhaul a licensing business that once accounted for half of its profit. Meanwhile, Apple's legal challenge has left it without access to Qualcomm's market-leading 5G modem chips, putting its most important product, the iPhone, a step behind Android competitors in the race to the next big advance in wireless. Billions of dollars in damages are up for grabs. Apple's contract manufacturers, who paid the disputed royalties under the Apple-Qualcomm licensing agreement, are seeking $9 billion in alleged overpayments to Qualcomm -- a sum that could soar to $27 billion under U.S. antitrust law that allows a jury to increase damages in cases involving anticompetitive behavior. A lawyer representing four contract manufacturers that make iPads and iPhones -- Foxconn Technology Group (formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.), Pegatron Corp., Wistron Corp. and Compal Electronics Inc. -- produced a copy of a contract he said showed a patent license was required before Qualcomm chips could be purchased or software could be used. Qualcomm has countered by seeking $7 billion in royalties that those Apple manufacturers started withholding as the legal battle commenced more than two years ago. Qualcomm could also argue that Apple, which it says encouraged the manufacturers to violate their contractual obligations, should pay a penalty of as much as $14 billion. Attorneys in the Apple-Qualcomm case must simplify their clients' complex dispute and make it accessible to jurors unfamiliar with intellectual-property law, said Michael Salzman, an attorney with Hughes, Hubbard & Reed who specializes in antitrust law related to intellectual property. ""This is up front and personal between the two parties,"" Mr. Salzman said. ""The jury is trying to figure out between the two who has the white hat and who has the black hat."" The two-year feud started as global smartphone sales slowed, pressuring both companies' businesses. Apple had paid Qualcomm $7.50 in royalties on every iPhone it sold since 2007 -- a price the parties reached with complex agreements that lowered Qualcomm's standard royalty rate through rebate and incentive payments. Apple also agreed to make Qualcomm the exclusive provider of modem chips for iPhones from 2011 to 2016. Apple added chips from Intel Corp. to some iPhone models in 2016, as its most recent contract with Qualcomm concluded. It then slapped Qualcomm with a lawsuit in January 2017. The companies were expected to settle their dispute long before the trial began. However, they have been so at odds over royalties that it has been difficult to make headway, people familiar with the situation said. Other issues have heightened the distrust. For example, Qualcomm executives suspected Apple of supporting a hostile takeover bid by Broadcom Inc., and Apple executives were angered that Qualcomm hired an opposition-research firm with ties to a news outlet that published articles calling the iPhone maker Silicon Valley's biggest bully. The companies are awaiting a ruling from a federal judge in an antitrust case brought by the Federal Trade Commission against Qualcomm that could weaken or strengthen Qualcomm's position -- by deciding whether Qualcomm's pricing policy for chips stifled competition. 16 Apr 2019 Apple and Qualcomm Agree to Drop All Litigation By Tripp Mickle BREAKING: * Qualcomm and Apple Agree to Drop All Litigation * Apple, Qualcomm Reached Global Patent License Agreement and Chipset Supply Agreement * Apple, Qualcomm Pact Also Ends All Ongoing Litigation With Apple's Contract Manufacturers * Apple, Qualcomm Settlement Includes a Payment From Apple to Qualcomm * Apple, Qualcomm License Pact Includes 2-Yr Option to Extend, and Multiyear Chipset Supply Agreement (Article below will update.)

Apple,Apple Earnings Are Coming. Here's What to Expect. -- Barrons.com,28 April 2020,Dow Jones Institutional News,"2,566 words",0.9904,0.102,0.058,0.84,"English , Inc. By Eric J. Savitz It has been more than two months since Apple warned that coronavirus-related supply and demand issues were going to prevent the company from hitting its original March quarter revenue guidance. On Jan. 28, Apple (ticker: AAPL) had projected revenue for the quarter of $63 billion to $67 billion -- and even then, the company said the range was wider than usual because of the potential impact of the virus. That was before there were any U.S. Covid-19 cases -- and how long ago that now seems. Apple will report March-quarter results after the close of trading on Thursday. The current Wall Street analyst consensus revenue forecast is $54.6 billion, but the estimates vary dramatically, with the low end of the Street range at $45.6 billion. The consensus profit forecast is $2.27 a share, but again, the range is wide, with estimates running from $1.73 to $2.73 a share. There are lots of things to watch for this quarter, and not just the final reveal on revenue. -- The company is widely expected to announce a new stock-repurchase plan. Apple has promised to eventually reach a zero net cash position; the company had about $100 billion in net cash at the end of the December quarter. Expectations are for a buyback in the $50 billion to $100 billion range, and potentially a dividend hike. -- Will Apple provide June quarter guidance? Given how low expectations are, it would be hard to shock investors, but the lack of any guidance would nonetheless disappoint. For the June quarter, the current consensus is $51.78 billion in revenue, with profits of $2.10 a share, but those are more guesstimates than estimates. -- Back in the precoronavirus days, there was a growing focus on Apple's services business as a growth driver. Investors will be looking for any detail on offerings like Apple Arcade, Apple TV+, Apple Card, and Apple Music, and how they have held up in the current crisis. -- Just how bad were iPhone sales hit in the downturn? That's the single biggest key to the March-quarter revenue story. But there are other iPhone questions, including the level of demand on the new second-generation iPhone SE and the state of the company's supply chain. There have also been widespread reports of strong demand for laptops for remote workers and students. Investors will want to know how Macbook and iPad demand have held up in the downturn. -- Another key question is whether there will be any hints at all on the status of the much anticipated 5G iPhones. (The answer to that: probably not.) D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte, like others, wants Apple to provide an update on 5G. ""We see the current situation as a great illustration of the need for all consumers to have broadband connections; especially, to support remote working and learning,"" he writes in a recent research note. ""We see the next-generation wireless network as an important advancement in that regard."" -- CFRA analyst Angelo Zino asserts in a recent research note that investors should look past what will likely be ""anemic"" March- and June-quarter hardware sales, in particular for iPhones. He says June quarter iPhone sales could be as little as 41% of total Apple revenue -- the lowest contribution since the September 2011 quarter. But Zino thinks that could set up a strong launch for the 5G iPhones later this year. Zino keeps his Buy rating and $320 price target on the stock, which he says offers a combination of both ""flight to quality"" and ""stay at home"" themes. -- Deutsche Bank's Jeriel Ong wrote in a research note over the weekend that investors appear to be looking past the current troubles. Apple's stock has been resilient, almost too resilient in light of the broader macro deterioration, and we expect near-term fundamental downside,"" Ong writes. ""Long-term, we continue to believe that Apple is the best name to own in the IT Hardware landscape."" He maintains a Buy rating and $285 price target on Apple shares. -- D.A. Davidson's Forte also writes that Apple's shares provide a complex mix of challenges and opportunities. On the one hand, the company was hurt by the shutdown of production in China early in the virus outbreak, and outside China most Apple stores remain closed. The weakening economy poses a challenge for a company with premium-priced technology products. But the company is also likely seeing a boost for some products amid the shift to working and learning from home -- and should be well poised for a 5G iPhone launch later in the year. Forte has a Buy rating and $370 target on the stock. Apple shares are down 0.6%, at $281.54, in recent trading, and are down about 4% for the year to date. The S&P 500 is up 0.3% on Tuesday. 29 Apr 2020 Apple Earnings Are Coming. Here's What to Expect. -- Barrons.com By Eric J.

On Jan. 28, Apple (ticker: AAPL) had projected revenue for the quarter of $63 billion to $67 billion -- and even then, the company said the range was wider than usual because of the potential impact of the virus.

Apple,Pro Private Markets,17 September 2018,WSJ Pro Venture Capital,737 words,0.9952,0.108,0.027,0.865,"English , Inc. Apple Inc. made waves in the digital-health world last week when it unveiled technical additions to its smartwatch that effectively turn it into a medical device. The watch's electrocardiogram and fall-detection capabilities could help some consumers to monitor potentially serious health conditions. Moreover its approval by the Food and Drug Administration underscores the agency's growing embrace of Silicon Valley tech, startup executives said. However, Apple's move into digital health also presents a double-edge sword for startups that have developed similar technology. ""On one hand, it opens doors and shows that the FDA is serious about digital health,"" said Menlo Ventures Partner Greg Yap. ""But I do think they are cutting the legs out from under the initial players who offer their technology through Apple products. This was a clear signal they [Apple] can integrate applications they are interested in and just take it to the FDA themselves."" Perhaps no startup may feel the impact more than AliveCor Inc. Backed with more than $65 million from investors including Khosla Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures and the Mayo Clinic, AliveCor has several FDA-approved and patent-protected ECG tools. Last year, the FDA approved a wristband that continuously monitors heart rate to detect abnormalities. The big selling point of that wristband? It was designed specifically to enable the Apple Watch as a medical device. ""Apple's new product doesn't replace what we have,"" said AliveCor Chief Executive Vic Gundrota. ""Then again, they didn't do a live demo and we don't know exactly how it works yet. We have an incredibly strong patent portfolio and are just as eager to see it as anyone."" Although Apple has steadily deepened its health-care work and applied for a patent on a wearable ECG in 2016, its announcement last week still surprised many in the industry. In 2015 CEO Tim Cook said Apple didn't want to put the watch through the FDA process. Many digital-health startups have struggled to work with the agency, which is just now beginning to formalize how it regulates their technologies. Now some of those startups face competition from a trillion-dollar company that received FDA approval curiously fast and with perfect timing. ""The clearances came the day before a major announcement, and the FDA also made an announcement of its own in support of Apple. It's hard to believe it is pure coincidence,"" said Bradley Merrill Thompson, a lawyer with Epstein Becker & Green who specializes in FDA, medical devices and pharmaceuticals. Mr. Thompson was careful to point out it is impossible to know how long Apple was working toward the FDA approval—it's common for companies to try to time their regulatory clearances with big medical conferences. That said, Apple is different. ""It's been an issue for years, and startups are always worried about working with big companies,"" Mr. Thompson said. ""But this was really over the top."" On the upside, said AliveCor's Mr. Gundrota, Apple's announcement could raise awareness of ECG technology. He said his company's website traffic doubled after the Apple event. In the meantime, Mr. Gundrota said his company is working to establish itself with increasingly sophisticated heart-monitoring technology. A few days before the Apple announcement, the FDA gave AliveCor's ""breakthrough device"" designation for its latest product, which uses artificial intelligence and ECG technology to screen for a condition called hyperkalemia, which commonly occurs with chronic diseases like diabetes or heart conditions. Other startups like Qardio Inc. and Beat Inc., which also make FDA-approved heart-monitoring devices, will also have to stay ahead of Apple with capabilities that differentiate their technology. For those that only make software, like Andreessen Horowitz-backed Cardiogram Inc., the challenge lies in expanding its services to users. ""You always have to be careful with the platforms your technology works with, because they are always going to expand their feature sets over time,"" said Cardiogram CEO Brandon Ballinger. ""I wouldn't be hesitant to work with Apple or Google or Garmin or anyone, but you always have to think about the long-term defensibility of your company."" (""mailto:Heather.Mack@wsj.com"")"
Apple,WSJ Pro,5 February 2019,WSJ Pro Cybersecurity,"1,078 words",-0.9923,0.044,0.094,0.862,"English , Inc. Cyber Daily: Can You Explain Why It Took So Long to Reveal That Security Problem? By Kim S. Nash Good day. Companies should pay attention to an investigation by New York regulators into how Apple Inc. handled the discovery of a bug in its FaceTime app that allows users to spy on each other. Regulators are taking more interest in why some companies reveal cybersecurity problems quickly and others seem to wait. That notification period, and the time it takes a company to repair a problem, must be explainable and reasonable, experts tell WSJ Pro Cybersecurity's Catherine Stupp. But because the U.S. lacks a uniform federal law that defines terms, states are beginning to step in and ask questions -- and all 50 states have different rules. ********** Regulators Apply More Pressure on Companies to Report Security Problems Fast By Catherine Stupp A New York investigation into Apple Inc.'s handling of a security flaw in the FaceTime video application could signal regulators' increased scrutiny of how long companies take to disclose and fix cybersecurity problems. The New York Attorney General Letitia James and Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced last week that they opened an investigation into Apple's actions after discovering a flaw that allowed FaceTime users to eavesdrop on recipients. News of the problem spread on Jan. 28, and Apple disabled the Group FaceTime feature that day. A teenager and his mother tried to inform the company about the problem for more than a week before Apple began fixing it. In a statement on Jan. 30, the attorney general's office referred to reports that Apple knew about the flaw more than a week before it disabled FaceTime. A spokeswoman for the attorney general declined to comment on which laws Apple might have violated. New York state's data breach law requires companies to notify affected people about an incident in ""the most expedient time possible."" A separate law that applies only to financial services companies requires data-breach reports with 72 hours to the New York Department of Financial Services. Under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, companies must notify regulators within 72 hours of discovering a breach. In the absence of a similar national law in the U.S., state legislators and regulators are pressing companies to report data-security incidents faster than they have been. New York's Apple investigation could set a precedent for what regulators consider to be a reasonable delay before a firm reacts to a data breach, experts said. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Federal regulators have brought cases against companies for failing to notify customers and to fix security flaws quickly. The Federal Trade Commission settled a complaint against hardware manufacturer ASUSTeK Computer Inc. in 2016 over an eight-month delay between discovering a security problem and notifying customers. ""I'm not sure there's a magic formula of this many days,"" said Maureen Ohlhausen, a partner at law firm Baker Botts LLP who served as an FTC commissioner until last September. The Massachusetts attorney general filed a lawsuit against Equifax Inc. for failing to inform consumers and the attorney general's office in a timely manner after its 2017 data breach. Equifax informed the attorney general in early September, nearly two months after it discovered the incident. The case is pending. The New York regulators' inquiry into Apple for taking one week to disclose and fix the FaceTime flaw reflects a misunderstanding of how companies vet tips from security researchers, said Katie Moussouris, chief executive officer of Luta Security Inc., a company that advises businesses on bug bounty programs. ""You have to have a process on the backend to triage all these reports, from the spam to the real reports, and to assess the prioritization for fixing them,"" she said. Regulators likely will look into when Apple was able to assess and test the information that it received about the FaceTime flaw, said Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and technology policy at Consumer Reports. ""The norms are not really established here,"" said Mr. Brookman, who previously served as a policy director at the FTC and worked on technology cases at the New York attorney general's office. ********** Big Number 59% Percentage of breaches caused by employees at health care organizations, through errors and misuse, according to Verizon's latest data breach investigations report. Health care is the only industry in which insiders are a bigger threat than outside hackers, Verizon says. ********** More Cyber News Apple revs up cold war over privacy. The battle between Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google centers on the treatment of user data and consumers are caught in the crossfire, The Wall Street Journal reports. Apple's recent decision to shut off developer iPhone apps at Facebook and Google, which were distributing research apps through a program Apple intended only for developers, showed how Apple is willing to use its power to discourage data collecting and ad targeting practices. A closed internet? Apple has no monopoly in smartphones but it holds extraordinary sway as gatekeeper of the closed internet, aka the App Store, not just over other companies, the Journal says: Apple can in theory turn off whole chunks of the internet for its entire user base. Behind an FBI sting on Huawei. Akhan Semiconductor Inc., a U.S. manufacturer of a diamond glass smartphone screen, was drafted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a sting on Huawei Technologies Co. that took place at last month's Consumer Electronics Show, Bloomberg Businessweek reports. The company suspected that Huawei -- which federal prosecutors charged on Jan. 28 with multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy -- was trying to steal the technology after a sample sent to a Huawei lab came back months late and badly damaged. The operation has not resulted in any charges yet, according to the report. Cryptocurrency exchange struggles to recover funds after founder dies. Cryptocurrency investors are locked out of about $190 million in digital assets after the founder of QuadrigaCX, Canada's largest cryptocurrency exchange, died, The Guardian reports. Quadriga founder Gerald Cotten died in December from complications from Crohn's disease, and the laptop from which he carried out the company's business is encrypted, according to his widow. The company filed an application for creditor protection in Nova Scotia on Jan. 31."

He says Apple has alternative sources to its suppliers in Wuhan, which has been at the center of the outbreak. The effect of the virus on the rest of Apple 's supply chain is less clear, but Cook says Apple is working on mitigation plans to account for any production losses. He says factories outside of Wuhan have pushed back plans to reopen after the Lunar New Year to Feb. 10 from the end of January. Still, Cook says the company's guidance for record revenue in the current quarter took those factors into account. (tripp.mickle@wsj.com) Apple 's services business benefited from the addition of services such as its credit card and Apple TV+, helping it set a revenue record of $12.7B. Sill, Apple declined to say how much of a help they provided. The company didn't disclose subscription numbers for the TV, videogame or News services it introduced last year. The company did say it had 100M active users for its Apple News app, but it didn't say anything about subscriptions sold for its News+ app that costs $9.99 a month. CFO Luca Maestri says Apple has hit its 2017 goal of $50B in annual services revenue on a run-rate basis. He says Apple Music, iCloud and Apple Care posted revenue records. (tripp.mickle@wsj.com) Apple 's wearables business delivers a whopping 37% increase in sales for the quarter, and it could have been more. Chief Executive Tim Cook says Apple 's older smartwatch model and its high-end AirPods were supply constrained in the quarter.

Cook, who likes to put business segments in the context of the Fortune 500, says the wearables business was now the size of a Fortune 150 company. (tripp.mickle@wsj.com) The viral outbreak in China has rattled investors but not Apple . The company sent a clear signal that it remains bullish about its supply chain and sales in the current quarter, posting revenue guidance above analysts' estimates of $63B to $67B. It's an improvement on last year's revenue of $58.01B. The bullish sales figures suggest Apple doesn't anticipate its supply chain will be disrupted in a way that hurts sales. It also implies that it still expects to have sufficient sales in China, a market that counts for about a fifth of sales. (tripp.mickle@wsj.com) Apple has shaken free of the iPhone slump that dogged it last year, posting record revenue and a return to profit growth in its latest quarter behind strong sales of iPhones, apps and its AirPods wireless earbuds.

Apple,Press Release: Apple Accelerates US Investment and Job Creation,17 January 2018,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,390 words",0.9983,0.128,0.002,0.87,"English , Inc. Apple Accelerates US Investment and Job Creation $350 Billion Contribution to US Economy Over Next Five Years CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 17, 2018-- Apple (R) today announced a new set of investments to build on its commitment to support the American economy and its workforce, concentrated in three areas where Apple has had the greatest impact on job creation: direct employment by Apple , spending and investment with Apple 's domestic suppliers and manufacturers, and fueling the fast-growing app economy which Apple created with iPhone(R) and the App Store(R). Apple is already responsible for creating and supporting over 2 million jobs across the United States and expects to generate even more jobs as a result of the initiatives being announced today. Combining new investments and Apple 's current pace of spending with domestic suppliers and manufacturers -- an estimated $55 billion for 2018 -- Apple 's direct contribution to the US economy will be more than $350 billion over the next five years, not including Apple 's ongoing tax payments, the tax revenues generated from employees' wages and the sale of Apple products. Planned capital expenditures in the US, investments in American manufacturing over five years and a record tax payment upon repatriation of overseas profits will account for approximately $75 billion of Apple 's direct contribution. ""Apple is a success story that could only have happened in America, and we are proud to build on our long history of support for the US economy, "" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. ""We believe deeply in the power of American ingenuity, and we are focusing our investments in areas where we can have a direct impact on job creation and job preparedness. We have a deep sense of responsibility to give back to our country and the people who help make our success possible."" Apple , already the largest US taxpayer, anticipates repatriation tax payments of approximately $38 billion as required by recent changes to the tax law. A payment of that size would likely be the largest of its kind ever made. Growing Apple 's US Operations Apple expects to invest over $30 billion in capital expenditures in the US over the next five years and create over 20,000 new jobs through hiring at existing campuses and opening a new one. Apple already employs 84,000 people in all 50 states. The company plans to establish an Apple campus in a new location, which will initially house technical support for customers. The location of this new facility will be announced later in the year. Over $10 billion of Apple 's expanded capital expenditures will be investments in data centers across the US. Over the last decade, Apple has invested billions of dollars in data centers and co-located facilities in seven US states, including North Carolina, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, and a recently announced project in Iowa. Today, Apple is breaking ground on a new facility in downtown Reno, which will support its existing Nevada facilities. All of Apple 's US facilities, including offices, retail stores and data centers, are powered by 100 percent renewable energy sources like solar, wind and micro-hydro power, which Apple generates or purchases from local projects. The new campus announced today will also be powered entirely by green energy. Investing in Apple 's Domestic Suppliers and Manufacturing Partners Building on the initial success of the Advanced Manufacturing Fund announced last spring, Apple is increasing the size of the fund from $1 billion to $5 billion. The fund was established to support innovation among American manufacturers and help others establish a presence in the US. It is already backing projects with leading manufacturers in Kentucky and rural Texas. Apple works with over 9,000 American suppliers -- large and small businesses in all 50 states -- and each of Apple 's core products relies on parts or materials made in the US or provided by US-based suppliers. Preparing Students for the App Economy Apple , which has a 40-year history in education, also plans to accelerate its efforts across the US in support of coding education as well as programs focused on Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM). The iOS app economy has created more than 1.6 million jobs in the US and generated $5 billion in revenue for American app developers in 2017. With demand for coding skills stronger than ever, today there are more than 500,000 unfilled programming-related positions across the country, and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that by 2020 there will be 1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants qualified to fill them.(1) To address the coding skills gap and help prepare more people for jobs in software development, Apple created a powerful yet easy-to-learn coding language called Swift(TM), the free Swift Playgrounds(TM) app and a free curriculum, App Development with Swift, which are available to anyone and are already being used by millions of students at K-12 schools, summer camps and leading community colleges across the country. Over 100,000 students and teachers have also attended coding classes at Apple retail stores. Apple will expand these initiatives and add new programs to support teachers and teacher training. The company is also increasing funding for its ConnectED program, so students in historically underserved communities have a chance to learn app coding skills and enjoy other benefits of technology in the classroom. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple 's four software platforms -- iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS -- provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple 's more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.

Apple,Technology,11 December 2018,The Wall Street Journal Online,894 words,-0.9832,0.028,0.075,0.896,"A Chinese court ordered Apple Inc. to stop selling older iPhone models after finding the company infringed on two patents held by Qualcomm Inc., the chip maker said, casting uncertainty over Apple's business in a critical market amid thorny trade relations between the U.S. and China. The Nov. 30 decision by a Chinese court, which doesn't apply to new iPhone models launched this year, is the first in the world's largest smartphone market that seeks to curtail iPhone sales in the country. Apple said its full portfolio of iPhones in China remain on sale, and that it plans to appeal the court's decision. The company filed a request to the court to reconsider its decision on Monday. Qualcomm said the Fuzhou Intermediate People's Court in China found Apple had infringed on two patents: one related to photo editing and another to swiping on a touch-screen device. The court order barring import and sales covers the iPhone X, 8, 7 and 6 models. It didn't include Apple's newest devices—the XS, XS Max and XR—because those models weren't on the market when the patent case was filed. It wasn't immediately clear when any such ban might take effect. Apple already has phased out selling some iPhone models globally, including the 6s, 6s Plus and X. As of Monday, Apple's China website was still selling the iPhone 7 and 8 family of phones, as well as the newest releases. When Micron Technology Inc. received a similar injunction in July from the same Chinese court in a patent case, Micron complied with the decision by ending sales of some memory products in China while requesting the court reconsider its ruling. The injunction ruling came in patent infringement cases brought by United Microelectronics Corp. and Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., a Taiwanese chip company and a Chinese chip company that Micron sued in the U.S. for intellectual-property theft. The preliminary injunction is the latest turn in a long-running legal dispute between Apple and Qualcomm. The San Diego chip company has brought more than a dozen cases against Apple over patent infringement in China over the past two years. Apple has built a sizable business in China, relying on the country for about a fifth of its annual revenue. The iPhone maker doesn't break down sales by models, and analysts' estimates vary. RBC Capital Markets on Monday estimated older models account for about 40% of sales in China, and that the ban could have an impact on about $12 billion in sales. The ruling comes as China and the U.S. have been locked in a monthslong trade battle. The U.S. has imposed tariffs on more than $200 billion in Chinese goods , alleging unfair trade practices and intellectual-property theft. China has retaliated with tariffs of its own on U.S. goods. A new rift between the countries opened this month after Huawei Technologies Co.'s finance chief was arrested in Canada on behalf of U.S. authorities. She is accused of lying to banks about Huawei's ties to a company that did business in Iran, in violation of U.S. sanctions. The companies both said they were informed of the Chinese court's decision last week. Qualcomm said the decision was dated Nov. 30, which would be a day before the arrest of the Huawei executive. Timothy Arcuri, an analyst with the investment bank UBS, said the timing of the decision raises the possibility that it is related to the broader U.S.-China trade dispute. He said Qualcomm has been in the process of validating some 23 patents in China for about a year, but this is the first court decision in Qualcomm's favor on those patents. ""The timing seems suspect to say the least,"" Mr. Arcuri said. ""This was a very convenient way to bring Apple into the fray in the same way the U.S. government did with Huawei."" Apple and Qualcomm have been engaged in a wide-ranging legal battle for nearly two years. The dispute began in January 2017, when Apple filed a lawsuit over Qualcomm's practice of collecting royalties on the entire sales price of an iPhone up to $400. Qualcomm says it charges a percentage of an entire device because its patents, essential to implementing cellular-communication standards, relate to cellular devices as a whole, not just its chips. During the dispute, Apple has withheld billions in royalty payments from Qualcomm. The chip maker has responded by suing Apple for infringing on Qualcomm patents in the U.S., China and Germany. It is seeking an injunction on iPhone sales in those markets, which analysts say is a part of a strategy to pressure Apple to negotiate a resolution to the licensing dispute. Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said during an appearance on CNBC in November that the companies are ""on the doorstep"" of a resolution. However, Apple's attorneys have said in court proceedings in San Diego that the parties aren't engaged in settlement discussions. (""mailto:Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com"")"
Apple,"Apple Wins Tax Case, Dealing a Blow to EU",16 July 2020,The Wall Street Journal,931 words,0.975,0.097,0.068,0.836,"Apple Inc. won a major battle with the European Union when the bloc's second-highest court sided with the U.S. company over a 13 billion euro ($14.8 billion) tax bill EU antitrust officials had said the company owed to Ireland. The decision was a rebuke to Margrethe Vestager, who is leading the charge at the European Commission to rein in alleged abuses by big tech companies including Apple, Alphabet Inc.'s Google, and Amazon.com Inc. But Wednesday's setback might at the same time embolden Ms. Vestager and other EU leaders in their push to create new regulations for tech companies because they argue that existing rules are insufficient to bring big tech companies to heel in areas ranging from competition to taxes. The case stems from a 2016 decision by the European Commission, the bloc's top antitrust enforcer, which said Ireland must recoup 13 billion euros in allegedly unpaid taxes between 2003 and 2014, money the commission said constituted an illegal subsidy under the bloc's strict state-aid rules. The General Court swept aside that reasoning, saying it annulled the decision because the commission had failed to meet the legal standards in showing that Apple was illegally given special treatment. The 2016 decision against Apple was one of Ms. Vestager's first big broadsides against tech companies in her role running the EU's competition enforcement. She later issued Google three fines totaling $9.4 billion, and launched formal antitrust probes into Amazon and Apple. She is now also responsible for tech regulation and is considering imposing a digital tax on tech giants. After Wednesday's decision, Ms. Vestager said she would ""carefully study the judgment and reflect on possible next steps"" and vowed to continue investigations into national tax deals with corporations to establish whether they constitute illegal subsidies. ""The Commission stands fully behind the objective that all companies should pay their fair share of tax,"" she said, adding that if one EU government gives corporations tax benefits that aren't available to their rivals, ""this harms fair competition in the EU."" In a September hearing at the General Court, Apple's lawyers said the commission's decision to call for the payment ""defied reality and common sense"" and Apple's CEO Tim Cook at the time slammed the decision as ""total political crap."" The company, however, had parked the sum in an escrow account, pending adjudication in EU courts. The commission can still challenge the Apple ruling at the bloc's top court, the European Court of Justice. In recent comments, however, Ms. Vestager pointed to the limitations of state-aid law in enforcing what she describes as ""paying your fair share of tax."" The overturning of the Apple decision comes at a sensitive time in the battle over how much tax big tech companies should pay -- and where they should pay it. European countries and the U.S. are at an impasse in international talks on the topic, with Europeans pushing for rules that would make tech companies pay more levies where their customers are based, and Americans rejecting a system that doesn't apply to all companies. Several countries, including France, have unilaterally imposed taxes on tech companies. EU leaders, including Ms. Vestager, have said the EU would do the same if there isn't progress at an international level by the end of this year. Apple and Ireland applauded on Wednesday the annulment of the tax case. Ireland reiterated that it gave no special treatment to Apple and said the company had paid taxes according to ""normal Irish taxation rules."" Apple said it supports international talks over how countries should divide up taxation rights for multinational companies. ""This case was not about how much tax we pay, but where we are required to pay it. We're proud to be the largest taxpayer in the world as we know the important role tax payments play in society,"" an Apple spokesman said. Tax activists, however, said the decision reinforces their call for new rules. While the Apple tax case isn't legally related to other antitrust enforcement Ms. Vestager is pursuing, Wednesday's decision might dent her reputation and cast doubts on the solidity of other cases. The commission is currently defending a similar taxation case against Amazon and three antitrust decisions against Google in court. The tax case overturned in Wednesday's ruling is based on a quirk of EU law aimed at creating a level playing field for companies across the bloc by forbidding governments from granting companies some types of state aid. A central issue in the Apple case was whether two Irish tax rulings granted to Apple in 1991 and 2007 gave a form of special treatment to the company, or whether they just reiterated an interpretation of Irish tax law as it was applied more generally. Those rulings allowed two Irish-registered Apple units to attribute only a small sliver of some $130 billion in profit to Ireland in an 11-year period. The commission said all that revenue should be attributed to Ireland, but the Irish government and Apple said they split the profit reasonably, given that almost all of Apple's intellectual property is developed in the U.S., not Ireland. In Wednesday's ruling, the General Court said despite the gaps in the contested tax rulings, the commission hadn't proven the Irish government granted a special advantage to Apple that was unavailable to other companies in Ireland."
Apple,Tim Cook and Apple Bet Everything on China. Then Coronavirus Hit.,2 March 2020,Dow Jones Institutional News,"5,799 words",0.8888,0.058,0.043,0.899,"English , Inc. Long before Donald Trump moved into the White House or the coronavirus paralyzed the city of Wuhan, Apple Inc.'s operations team began raising concerns about the technology giant's dependency on China. Some operations executives suggested as early as 2015 that the company relocate assembly of at least one product to Vietnam. That would allow Apple to begin the multiyear process of training workers and creating a new cluster of component providers outside the world's most populous nation, people familiar with the discussions said. Senior managers rebuffed the idea. For Apple, weaning itself off a stubborn dependency on China, its second-largest consumer market and the place where most of its products are assembled, has been too challenging to undertake. Apple's addiction to manufacturing in China has long frustrated staff -- and more recently unnerved investors. The coronavirus represents Apple's third major setback there in as many years, including the fallout from tensions with the U.S. that included tariffs and slower-than-expected iPhone sales in the country. Factory production has been crippled as China has shut down activities and sought to contain the outbreak, and Apple warned investors it won't meet its own sales estimates in the current quarter. Since that warning, Apple's market value has declined by more than $100 billion. ""No executive will admit in a public forum: We should have thought about"" the vulnerability to China, said Burak Kazaz, a Syracuse University supply chain professor and former researcher at International Business Machines Corp. ""But from this point on, there are no excuses."" China has been a critical factor in Apple's once-soaring $1.4 trillion market value. The country provides a stable, efficient, low-cost manufacturing base with an abundant network of suppliers that have helped cement Apple's profitability. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook continues to play down the need to significantly change Apple's supply chain. During an interview Thursday with Fox Business Network, he said unpredictable events are a facet of modern business and noted that Apple's operations team has previously navigated earthquakes, tsunamis and other challenges. ""The question for us is: Was the resilience there or not? And do we need to make some changes?"" Mr. Cook said. ""My perspective sitting here today is that if there are changes, you're talking about adjusting some knobs, not some sort of wholesale fundamental change."" Apple has recently started to experiment with small production moves out of China. These attempts, including plans to assemble wireless earbuds in Vietnam and produce iPhones in India and Mac Pro computers in the U. S., have laid bare a number of difficulties. A clean break with China is impossible. Apple relies on a workforce of more than three million indirect workers in China. Its top manufacturer, Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Group, hires hundreds of thousands of seasonal employees in China, many of whom manually insert tiny screws and thin printed circuit boards during the iPhone assembly process, people familiar with the process said. Tens of thousands of experienced manufacturing engineers oversee the process. Finding a comparable amount of unskilled and skilled labor is impossible, said Dan Panzica, a former Foxconn executive. The population in China has allowed suppliers to build mega-factories with a capacity for more than 250,000 people. The number of migrant workers in China, who do much of Apple's production, exceed Vietnam's total population of 100 million. India is the closest comparison, but its roads, ports and infrastructure lag far behind those in China. ""You're not going to be able to have mega-factories anywhere else,"" Mr. Panzica said. ""You're going to have to break them up."" Moving out could also jeopardize Apple sales in China, which counts for nearly a fifth of its total revenue. Employing so many local workers helped the company gain access to the market and any reduction might weaken its standing with the government, which wields tremendous influence over how global brands are perceived, according to Neil Mawston, a technology researcher with the firm Strategy Analytics. Though Apple's brand remains strong in China, its share of the smartphone market has declined to 7.5% from a peak of 12.5% in 2015 because of pressure from homegrown rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co., according to Canalys, a market research firm. Mr. Cook, who joined the company in 1998, is the architect of Apple's China business. As head of operations, he assumed responsibility for a company saddled with extra inventory and reliant on its own U.S. manufacturing plants. Following the practices of Dell, Compaq and other computer brands, he started outsourcing to contract manufacturers in Asia. Around 2000, he met Foxconn founder Terry Gou, who would become the dominant contract manufacturer in Asia. Foxconn struck deals to be one of the few manufacturers of iPods, which made its debut in 2001, and an early maker of the iPhone, which launched in 2007. Beijing was supporting tech manufacturing because it wanted its factories to make more-sophisticated products rather than plastic toys and clothes. In 2001, Apple officially entered China with a Shanghai-based trading company. As iPhone sales surged, Apple, Foxconn and China scrambled to meet the demand. In 2010, China took over farmland in Zhengzhou, and within months, a Foxconn factory complex was built for 250,000 workers. The government also has helped funnel workers to Foxconn, posting notices online. Conditions in China challenged Apple. Suicides at Foxconn factories and reports of employees exceeding a 60-hour workweek led to criticism of the company, which publishes an annual supplier responsibility report evaluating workplace conditions. Apple says it holds suppliers to the strictest standards in the industry. Over time, Apple, Foxconn and China formed a triangle of dependency. Apple grew to depend on Foxconn to make devices and Chinese consumers to buy them. Foxconn built its business by leaning on China's vast workforce and control over land to construct factories. And China became beholden to Foxconn as the nation's largest private-sector employer and Apple as a trainer of new technology suppliers. The entanglement unnerved some Apple executives, who encouraged company leaders to look outside China to minimize the risks of labor unrest or a change in Beijing's position on Apple. President Trump's policies rocked the relationship. After winning the election, Mr. Trump said in Time magazine that he told Mr. Cook that he wanted Apple ""to build a great plant, your biggest and your best, even if it's only a foot bigger than some place in China."" The administration later started levying tariffs on imports of goods made in China. Mr. Cook managed to avert tariffs on Apple's bestselling product, the iPhone, telling President Trump it would put the company at a competitive disadvantage to its biggest rival, South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. But Apple wasn't able to avoid tariffs on headphones and other devices. Samsung isn't subject to the tariffs because it moved most of its smartphone manufacturing out of China in recent years. It is now assembling its signature phones in Vietnam, India and South Korea. The shift out of the country came after Samsung's share of China's smartphone market had already collapsed. It went from selling one in every five phones in 2014 to claiming less than a 1% share of the smartphone market, as homegrown rivals outmaneuvered it, and a plan to install a U.S. missile-defense system in South Korea upset Beijing, triggering a Chinese consumer backlash. Assembling a Samsung Galaxy in Vietnam is simpler because the company uses larger and more pre-assembled components, such as its display, according to former operations executives. The company also glues the phones together, a process that is easier to automate than inserting the tiny screws on an iPhone, said Kyle Wiens, founder of iFixit, a firm that analyzes smartphones. Apple's design team has long adhered to the philosophy of its former chief designer, Jony Ive, who believed that a well-made product required just as much precision and care on its interior design as its exterior look-and-feel. ""It's extremely intricate and complicated,"" said Mr. Panzica, formerly of Foxconn. Tariffs imposed on headphones were a catalyst for Apple to shift manufacturing of the AirPods Pro wireless earbuds from China to Vietnam, said Jeff Luo, a supply-chain analyst with Isaiah Research. He said Chinese contract manufacturers Luxshare Precision Industry Co. and GoerTek Inc. were told late last year to set up production by March at plants that should be able to make about 4 million units monthly of AirPods Pro. Luxshare said it couldn't comment on specific clients or products. GoerTek didn't respond to a request for comment. AirPods are easier to shift out of China because they have about a third as many components as an iPhone, which has about 1,000. They are also glued together rather than screwed, Mr. Luo said. A Communist country, Vietnam offers some of the same benefits as China. Labor is cheap, and officials have encouraged the development of industrial parks with lower tax rates. It also has its drawbacks. Few people speak English and manufacturing lines are typically run by people from China, which creates a communications gap. The manufacturing procedures are slightly more inefficient and the factories are still learning processes such as work orders, operations executives who have visited said. In India, Apple set up iPhone manufacturing partly to avoid the country's 20% tax on imports. It also wanted to comply with a law requiring single-brand foreign retailers to buy at least 30% of their manufacturing materials from India. 2 Mar 2020 Tim Cook and Apple Bet Everything on China. Then -2- In 2017, after several years of planning, it completed its first trial run for an iPhone SE using the contract manufacturer Wistron Corp. It has since begun making iPhones at a Foxconn factory near Chennai. Apple has been cautious as Indian workers gain experience. Last year, it was hurtling ahead with a plan to make the iPhone 11 in India, a manufacturing first for a company that had long relied on China to assemble its newest models. But the technology giant halted the effort before setting up a single manufacturing line for that device, a person familiar with the matter said. India wasn't ready to supply skilled labor or the robust infrastructure Apple expects. It opted to make the iPhone 11 in China instead. Apple is unlikely to shift any of the production of its most expensive iPhones to India later this year, a person familiar with Foxconn's overseas operations said. The supply chain isn't in place, and workers in India aren't ready to produce the high-end, organic light-emitting diode models, this person said.

Then Coronavirus Hit. By Tripp Mickle and Yoko Kubota Long before the coronavirus struck, Apple Inc.'s operations team began raising concerns about the technology giant's dependency on China. Some operations executives suggested as early as 2015 that the company relocate assembly of at least one product to Vietnam. That would allow Apple to begin the multiyear process of training workers and creating a new cluster of component providers outside the world's most populous nation, people familiar with the discussions said. Senior managers rebuffed the idea. For Apple, weaning itself off China, its second-largest consumer market and the place where most of its products are assembled, has been too challenging to undertake. Apple's reliance on China has long frustrated staff -- and more recently unnerved investors. The coronavirus represents Apple's third major setback there in as many years, including the fallout from tensions with the U.S. that included tariffs and slower-than-expected iPhone sales in the country. Factory production has been crippled as China has shut down activities and sought to contain the outbreak, and Apple warned investors it won't meet its own sales estimates in the current quarter. Since that warning, Apple's market value has declined by more than $100 billion. ""No executive will admit in a public forum: We should have thought about"" the vulnerability to China, said Burak Kazaz, a Syracuse University supply chain professor and former researcher at International Business Machines Corp. ""But from this point on, there are no excuses."" China has been a critical factor in Apple's soaring market value. The country provides a stable, efficient, low-cost manufacturing base with an abundant network of suppliers that have helped cement Apple's profitability. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook continues to play down the need to significantly change Apple's supply chain. During an interview Thursday with Fox Business Network, he said unpredictable events are a facet of modern business and noted that Apple's operations team has previously navigated earthquakes, tsunamis and other challenges. ""The question for us is: Was the resilience there or not? And do we need to make some changes?"" Mr. Cook said. ""My perspective sitting here today is that if there are changes, you're talking about adjusting some knobs, not some sort of wholesale fundamental change."" Apple has recently started to experiment with small production moves out of China. These attempts, including plans to assemble wireless earbuds in Vietnam and produce iPhones in India and Mac Pro computers in the U. S., have laid bare a number of difficulties. A clean break with China is impossible. Apple relies on a workforce of more than three million indirect workers in China. Its top manufacturer, Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Group, hires hundreds of thousands of seasonal employees in China, many of whom manually insert tiny screws and thin printed circuit boards during the iPhone assembly process, people familiar with the process said. Tens of thousands of experienced manufacturing engineers oversee the process. Finding a comparable amount of unskilled and skilled labor is impossible, said Dan Panzica, a former Foxconn executive. The population in China has allowed suppliers to build factories with a capacity for more than 250,000 people. The number of migrant workers in China, who do much of Apple's production, exceed Vietnam's total population of 100 million. India is the closest comparison, but its roads, ports and infrastructure lag far behind those in China. ""You're not going to be able to have mega-factories anywhere else,"" Mr. Panzica said. ""You're going to have to break them up."" Moving out could also jeopardize Apple sales in China, which counts for nearly a fifth of its total revenue. Employing so many local workers helped the company gain access to the market and any reduction might weaken its standing with the government, which wields tremendous influence over how global brands are perceived, according to Neil Mawston, a technology researcher with the firm Strategy Analytics. Though Apple's brand remains strong in China, its share of the smartphone market has declined to 7.5% from a peak of 12.5% in 2015 because of pressure from homegrown rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co., according to Canalys, a market research firm. Mr. Cook, who joined the company in 1998, is the architect of Apple's China business. As head of operations, he assumed responsibility for a company saddled with extra inventory and reliant on its own U.S. manufacturing plants. Following the practices of Dell, Compaq and other computer brands, he started outsourcing to contract manufacturers in Asia. Around 2000, he met Foxconn founder Terry Gou, who would become the dominant contract manufacturer in Asia. Foxconn struck deals to be one of the few manufacturers of iPods, which made its debut in 2001, and an early maker of the iPhone, which launched in 2007. Beijing was supporting tech manufacturing because it wanted its factories to make more-sophisticated products rather than plastic toys and clothes. In 2001, Apple officially entered China with a Shanghai-based trading company. As iPhone sales surged, Apple, Foxconn and China scrambled to meet the demand. In 2010, China took over farmland in Zhengzhou, and within months, a Foxconn factory complex was built for 250,000 workers. The government also has helped funnel workers to Foxconn, posting notices online. Conditions in China challenged Apple. Suicides at Foxconn factories and reports of employees exceeding a 60-hour workweek led to criticism of the company, which publishes an annual supplier responsibility report evaluating workplace conditions. Apple says it holds suppliers to the strictest standards in the industry. Over time, Apple, Foxconn and China formed a triangle of interdependency. Apple grew to depend on Foxconn to make devices and Chinese consumers to buy them. Foxconn built its business by leaning on China's vast workforce and control over land to construct factories. And China became beholden to Foxconn as the nation's largest private-sector employer and Apple as a trainer of new technology suppliers. The entanglement unnerved some Apple executives, who encouraged company leaders to look outside China to minimize the risks of labor unrest or a change in Beijing's position on Apple. President Trump's policies rocked the relationship. After winning the election, Mr. Trump said in Time magazine that he told Mr. Cook that he wanted Apple ""to build a great plant, your biggest and your best, even if it's only a foot bigger than some place in China."" The administration later started levying tariffs on imports of goods made in China. Mr. Cook managed to avert tariffs on Apple's bestselling product, the iPhone, telling President Trump it would put the company at a competitive disadvantage to its biggest rival, South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. But Apple wasn't able to avoid tariffs on headphones and other devices. Samsung isn't subject to the tariffs because it moved most of its smartphone manufacturing out of China in recent years. It is now assembling its signature phones in Vietnam, India and South Korea. The shift out of the country came after Samsung's share of China's smartphone market had already collapsed. It went from selling one in every five phones in 2014 to claiming less than a 1% share of the smartphone market, as homegrown rivals outmaneuvered it, and a plan to install a U.S. missile-defense system in South Korea upset Beijing, triggering a Chinese consumer backlash. Assembling a Samsung Galaxy in Vietnam is simpler because the company uses larger and more pre-assembled components, such as its display, according to former operations executives. The company also glues the phones together, a process that is easier to automate than inserting the tiny screws on an iPhone, said Kyle Wiens, founder of iFixit, a firm that analyzes smartphones. Apple's design team has long adhered to the philosophy of its former chief designer, Jony Ive, who believed that a well-made product required just as much precision and care on its interior design as its exterior look-and-feel. ""It's extremely intricate and complicated,"" said Mr. Panzica, formerly of Foxconn. Tariffs imposed on headphones were a catalyst for Apple to shift manufacturing of the AirPods Pro wireless earbuds from China to Vietnam, said Jeff Luo, a supply-chain analyst with Isaiah Research. He said Chinese contract manufacturers Luxshare Precision Industry Co. and GoerTek Inc. were told late last year to set up production by March at plants that should be able to make about 4 million units monthly of AirPods Pro. Luxshare said it couldn't comment on specific clients or products. GoerTek didn't respond to a request for comment. AirPods are easier to shift out of China because they have about a third as many components as an iPhone, which has about 1,000. They are also glued together rather than screwed, Mr. Luo said. A Communist country, Vietnam offers some of the same benefits as China. Labor is cheap, and officials have encouraged the development of industrial parks with lower tax rates. It also has its drawbacks. Few people speak English and manufacturing lines are typically run by people from China, which creates a communications gap. The manufacturing procedures are slightly more inefficient and the factories are still learning processes such as work orders, operations executives who have visited said. In India, Apple set up iPhone manufacturing partly to avoid the country's 20% tax on imports. It also wanted to comply with a law requiring single-brand foreign retailers to buy at least 30% of their manufacturing materials from India. In 2017, after several years of planning, it completed its first trial run for an iPhone SE using the contract manufacturer Wistron Corp. It has since begun making iPhones at a Foxconn factory near Chennai. 3 Mar 2020 Tim Cook and Apple Bet Everything on China. Then -2- Apple has been cautious as Indian workers gain experience. Last year, it was hurtling ahead with a plan to make the iPhone 11 in India, a manufacturing first for a company that had long relied on China to assemble its newest models. But the technology giant halted the effort before setting up a single manufacturing line for that device, a person familiar with the matter said. India wasn't ready to supply skilled labor or the robust infrastructure Apple expects. It opted to make the iPhone 11 in China instead.

Apple,"EXCHANGE --- Keywords: Keep Your Eyes, and Ears, On Apple's Next Bold Gamble --- The tech giant is moving toward designing even more of its own silicon",30 April 2022,The Wall Street Journal,"1,404 words",0.99,0.074,0.021,0.905,"Apple has shown it can design the brains of its devices, and is now poised to do something potentially even harder: create the chips that enable them to communicate with the internet. A series of moves by the tech giant, as well as signals from its suppliers, make clear that it aims to start designing the modems of the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Doing so could enable a future of always-on smart glasses and augmented reality, more wearables with their own independent connection to cellular networks, Mac laptops with 5G connectivity, and faster-than-ever downloads and streaming on its flagship iPhones. But first, the company must accomplish something that has defeated other tech giants, including Intel: It must show that not only can it design its own wireless modems, but that it can make them good enough to justify switching away from the ones Apple now uses, which are made by Qualcomm, for decades the world's dominant modem-chip maker. Applications like full augmented reality -- overlaying a computer-generated reality atop the real world, and projecting it into our eyes through smart glasses -- will require faster-than-ever data transfer rates, and lower-than-ever latency, which is a measure of how long it takes a signal to make a round trip from a device to the internet. Achieving those blistering-fast speeds has put unprecedented demands on the creativity of engineers, who have delivered a 100-fold increase in peak data-transfer rates in the past 10 years, says Durga Malladi, head of 5G and mobile infrastructure at Qualcomm. And all of this has had to happen while keeping phones more or less the same size, and without requiring a comparable increase in the capacity of batteries, he adds. Apple keeps details of its chip operation, like much of the rest of its business, closely guarded secrets, and says almost nothing publicly about its aspirations. In a rare interview with my colleague Tim Higgins, Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of hardware technologies and leader of its chip division, discussed how it developed the A-series iPhone microprocessors and M-series for Macs, but declined to say anything about future plans, for modems or any other chips. There are, however, plenty of signposts showing where Apple is headed on modem chips. The company agreed in 2019 to acquire the majority of Intel's smartphone-modem business, including 2,200 employees, and since then has continued hiring engineers with related expertise, often at satellite offices in the same cities as its sometime-partners and possible future competitors in wireless technology. In San Diego, Qualcomm's hometown, Apple is advertising around 140 positions directly related to developing and integrating cellular modem chips. In Irvine, Calif. -- home to the headquarters of Broadcom, which designs critical parts that sit between a phone's modem and its antennas -- Apple has a satellite engineering office and, according to its own jobs website, around 20 open positions. Broadcom didn't respond to requests to comment. Mr. Malladi and a Qualcomm spokesman declined to comment on the company's relationship with Apple. In November 2021, Qualcomm's chief financial officer said the company expected to supply 20% of the 5G modems Apple uses in its mobile devices in 2023. Currently, Qualcomm supplies nearly 100% of these chips. (The exception is the Apple Watch, which since the Series 4 model has used an Intel modem.) While it's possible that Apple could be planning to use 5G modems from another supplier starting in 2023, analysts are expecting that will be the year it reveals its own, Apple-designed modem. As was the case with Apple's move to its own processors for iPhones and Macs, designing its own chips for cellular connectivity could give the company a number of advantages over competitors. The first is cost, says Wayne Lam, senior director of research at technology consulting firm CCS Insight. According to a recent analysis of the cost of materials in the newest iPhone SE, the first version of the more affordable iPhone model with 5G capability, the chips that allow the phone to connect to cell networks collectively cost as much or more than the chips that make up the ""brains"" of the phone -- the A15 processor and its attached memory chips. That's a reversal of what has been the norm for decades in smartphones and similar mobile devices: Typically, the main processor of the device has been more complicated and expensive than the parts that allow it to communicate wirelessly. It will also liberate Apple from supplier relationships that, whatever benefits they have provided, have at times been a source of tension. In 2019, for example, Apple settled a contentious court battle with Qualcomm over patent-licensing fees, agreeing to pay at least $4.5 billion and to purchase Qualcomm's modems for several years. Another big advantage Apple could gain is that, by integrating its own modems onto the same A-series chip that powers its phones, it could tweak them in ways that would make them faster, more efficient, and more capable than what's possible with its current combination of its own chips and Qualcomm's, says Mr. Lam. In thinking about what Apple could do with its own modems, it's worth looking at its history with its own chips. Apple began its journey of designing its own chips with the A-series that go into its phones. Its ability to make them more powerful is the reason it has been able to create the M-series for the Mac. These aren't only faster than the Intel-based ones they replaced, but also use less power, allowing Apple to eliminate fans in its laptops. Similarly, by creating its own modems, it could put better connectivity into smaller devices -- like its watch, and potential future smart glasses -- says Mr. Lam. Wireless engineering isn't for the faint of heart, but to boil down a mountain of technicalities into a single idea: The faster that mobile devices communicate with the internet, the more it matters that a device's modem is physically adjacent to, and designed in concert with, the chips that run all the apps and other software on a phone. Despite Apple's tremendous resources and growing army of wireless engineers, one thing that even the giant of Cupertino may find difficult to overcome is just how much time it takes to design, manufacture and then test a new wireless modem, says Prakash Sangam, founder of the tech research and advisory firm Tantra Analyst and a former wireless engineer at AT&T and director of marketing at Qualcomm. ""People often compare how Apple developed its A-series chipsets on their own, and how quickly they were able to up their game, but in some ways a modem is more complex,"" says Mr. Sangam. In part, that complexity arises because a modem must handle such a wide variety of circumstances that can interfere with a signal -- as Apple discovered during its infamous ""Antennagate"" episode more than a decade ago, when poor placement of the iPhone 4's antenna led to reception problems. ""If you throw enough time and resources and money at it, it can be done,"" he adds. ""But whether they can do it by 2023, I don't think anyone other than Apple can say."" Apple's first home-brewed modem might not be best in class in terms of speed or capabilities. But the company has demonstrated it has the patience and resources to keep releasing incrementally better hardware, until it can create devices different enough from competitors' to compel customer loyalty. If the same holds true for modems, it could mean that future Apple devices will do things that simply aren't possible with Apple's current combinations of its own chips and those of others. Those could include putting cellular connectivity into smaller devices -- possibly even AirPods -- or augmented-reality experiences that feel more real than what is currently possible. ""Once Apple's been able to perfect the technology for 5G modems in the iPhone, all they have to do is scale that tech down to a chipset that fits into, say, your Apple Glasses,"" says Mr. Lam."
Apple,Technology,30 April 2021,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,122 words",-0.9153,0.045,0.072,0.883,"The European Union charged Apple Inc. with antitrust violations for allegedly abusing its control over the distribution of music-streaming apps, broadening the battle over the tech giant's App Store practices ahead of a federal trial in the U.S. brought by ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games. The European Commission, the EU's top antitrust enforcer, on Friday issued a charge sheet against Apple that says the iPhone maker squeezed rival music-streaming apps by requiring them to use Apple's in-app payments system to sell digital content. The case stems from a complaint by Spotify Technology SA, which competes with Apple's music-streaming service. In addition, EU regulators say Apple ""distorted competition"" by limiting how app developers can inform users about cheaper ways to subscribe outside the app. Apple's in-app payment system imposes a 30% commission on purchases inside many of the most popular apps. ""This case is about the central role of app stores in the digital economy,"" Margrethe Vestager, who is in charge of competition enforcement at the European Commission, said at a press conference Friday. ""An app store can become a gatekeeper, in particular if there is only one app store available in a mobile ecosystem."" In response, Apple took aim at Spotify, saying the company has been successful, even after removing paid subscriptions from its iOS app in order to avoid Apple's fees. ""At the core of this case is Spotify's demand they should be able to advertise alternative deals on their iOS app, a practice that no store in the world allows,"" an Apple spokesman said. ""The Commission's argument on Spotify's behalf is the opposite of fair competition."" In the past, Applehas defended its practice of taking a cut of some sales through the App Store, and said it wants competing apps to thrive. Apple will have a chance to argue its case before the European Commission renders a decision. If found guilty, Apple could face a fine of up to 10% of its annual revenue and be forced to adjust its business practices, though it can also appeal any decision in court. Apple's Battles in Europe * Epic Games Files Antitrust Complaint Against Apple in Europe (Feb. 17, 2021) * Apple Faces Prolonged $15 Billion Tax Battle as EU Appeals (Sept. 25, 2020) * Apple Faces Two EU Antitrust Probes Over Apps (June 16, 2020) Spotify, for its part, painted its complaint as part of a broader battle. On Friday, Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify's head of global affairs, described the EU charges as ""a critical step toward holding Apple accountable for its anticompetitive behavior, ensuring meaningful choice for all consumers and a level playing field for app developers."" App developers have become increasingly outspoken against Apple over its App Store fees at issue in the EU charges, arguing that the entire mobile-app ecosystem is at stake. Next week a federal court will hear a lawsuit from Epic Games, which alleged Apple abused its dominance by kicking ""Fortnite"" out of the App Store for skirting Apple's payment system. In February, Epic Games also lodged an antitrust complaint against Applewith the European Commission on similar grounds, which the commission said it is examining. ""We will not stand idly by and allow Apple to use its platform dominance to control what should be a level digital playing field,"" Epic founder and Chief Executive Tim Sweeney said at the time. Apple has countersued Epic in the U.S. and rejected its claims in the EU. In response to the EU complaint, Apple described Epic's decision to go around Apple's in-app payment rules that apply to all developers as ""reckless behavior"" that ""made pawns of customers."" The EU charges come as the number of cases against large tech companies is growing on both sides of the Atlantic. In the U.S., the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and many U.S. states have filed antitrust lawsuits against Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc. American lawmakers are taking a closer look at tech corporations, too. Apple came under fire at a U.S. Senate antitrust hearing last week for its handling of its app store and smartphone ecosystem. ""The charges brought in Europe only reaffirm that app store policies and conduct deserve both careful scrutiny and action in our own country,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) said Friday. The EU, which formally opened the App Store case last year, is also probing Apple over its treatment of payment providers and app developers in its Apple Pay system, as well as its imposition of its in-app payments system for competing providers of electronic books. At the time, Apple said it required all developers to follow strict guidelines and is committed to a ""fair and level playing field for all developers."" The EU case deepens the bloc's long-running battle with Apple over tax and competition issues. In 2016, the European Commissionordered Apple to repay 13 billion euros , equivalent to $15.7 billion, but Apple won a court appeal of that order last summer. The commission has appealed to the bloc's highest court . At the core of the EU case against Apple is a question that is increasingly being asked by antitrust regulators and experts globally: What responsibilities should be placed on companies that serve millions of businesses and billions of consumers with services that in the eyes of many have become essential? Under particular scrutiny are companies that operate platforms used by thousands of other businesses. In November, the EU issued charges against Amazon.com Inc. for allegedly unfairly competing against merchants that sell goods via its retail site. Amazon disputed the allegations and said it would engage with the commission ""to ensure it has an accurate understanding of the facts."" In December, the EU also proposed a new bill that would impose new requirements on so-called gatekeeper businesses , defined as companies with high earnings and market capitalizations with more than 10,000 active business customers or 45 million active end users in the bloc. If the law is passed, something that could take years, gatekeeper companies would face obligations, such as not tying the ability to access one of their services to purchasing for another core service. Violators would be subject to fines of up to 10% of their annual world-wide revenue, or even orders to be broken up in some cases.

Apple,"Business News: Judge Weighs Debates in Apple Trial --- Earlier fights involving credit cards, railroads could influence iPhone maker's case with Epic",26 May 2021,The Wall Street Journal,"1,347 words",-0.8669,0.051,0.065,0.883,"The future of digital commerce on your iPhone could be influenced by how courts resolved questions about market control following technological innovations that disrupted previous generations: credit cards and railroads. With the courtroom battle between Epic Games Inc. and Apple Inc. concluded Monday, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers must now decide if the iPhone maker has improperly prohibited third-party app stores and forced developers to use its in-app payment system that collects a commission as high as 30%. As she decides if Apple has operated an illegal monopoly, she's already made it clear during the trial in Oakland, Calif., that she's thinking about how previous precedent-setting cases involving American Express Co. and a St. Louis railroad apply to the new digital economy in the 21st century. Her decision in the trial that lasted three weeks and a day is expected in the coming months, and it could sway a new generation of commerce. ""It's safe to say she's not just convinced that there's an easy win for Apple,"" said David Olson, an associate professor at Boston College Law School who has been following the case. ""She's thinking hard about this and seems to be bothered by the lack of in-app or in-game . . . payment systems."" The question of how to define a market in the case is a central issue. Is the market confined to distributing apps on the iPhone as ""Fortnite"" videogame creator Epic argues? Or, as Apple contends, is the market just devices on which videogames can be played? A comment by Judge Gonzalez Rogers on Friday suggests she may be looking at it as an app-distribution market. ""The gaming industry seems to be generating a disproportionate amount of money relative to the [intellectual property] that you're giving them and everybody else,"" she said when questioning Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook. ""In a sense, it's almost as if they're subsidizing everybody else."" On Monday, however, she raised the notion that the market might be the mobile videogame market -- an option that neither party raised. Judge Gonzalez Rogers has also suggested on multiple occasions that she doesn't believe Apple is setting its commission of as much as 30% based on competition, but rather has made its decision arbitrarily. If she's signaling a willingness to consider some of Epic's claims, she also seems unwilling to blow up Apple's business. During her comments Monday, she expressed concern that Epic's proposals for addressing its claims against Apple went too far. ""Give me some example that has survived appellate review where the court has engaged in such a way to either prohibit something or to fundamentally change the economic model of a monopolistic company,"" Judge Gonzalez Rogers said. Throughout the trial, she has indicated an interest in a longtime doctrine of antitrust law called essential facilities, which prohibits a dominant firm from using a bottleneck to block out competition. It comes from a 1912 case involving a group of railroads that blocked rivals with the control of bridges and rail yards in and out of St. Louis. Several times, Judge Gonzalez Rogers has chided Epic's lawyers for not providing evidence backing up a claim that Apple has an essential facility. Apple quickly filed a motion seeking to throw out the claim involving the doctrine. On Sunday, Epic argued in a filing that it had made its case. ""What Epic is saying is that we want Apple to allow us to deal on their platform, their iOS, and there are only two of these platforms, and, therefore, because there are only two competitors, all of these competitors can't succeed without access to these platforms -- this one and Google,"" the judge told a witness during the second week of the trial. She said the case seemed to revolve around an essential facilities claim. Richard Schmalensee, the dean emeritus of the business school at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a witness called by Apple, disagreed: Apple's operating system isn't a public utility, like a lone rail track into a town. Rather, he said, the disagreement between Epic and Apple is over Epic's desire to set up its own competing store. ""It could be that Apple nominally gives them access, but the terms are so unfavorable that as a business matter, they can't function,"" he said. ""But they've made a lot of money going through that store, so I think [Epic has] trouble making the argument."" Judge Gonzalez Rogers also probed Prof. Schmalensee on another area of legal precedent that suggested she was looking for a potential compromise. Part of Apple's terms to developers include a so-called anti-steering provision that prohibits them from sending users in the app outside of Apple's payment system to save money using a cheaper method. Epic's lawsuit was preceded by a plot to sneak its own in-app payment system into ""Fortnite"" aimed at circumventing Apple's, a violation of the rules that got it kicked out of the store. In response, Epic filed its lawsuit in August claiming Apple was a monopoly. Apple contends that its anti-steering provision is allowed by judicial precedent in a case involving American Express. In that case, the Supreme Court upheld AmEx's policy that prohibited merchants that accept its cards from steering consumers to use rival cards, such as Visa, so they could avoid fees. AmEx fees charged merchants are often higher. Prof. Schmalensee noted that AmEx wasn't part of a duopoly like Apple and Google, to which the judge responded: ""When you go into a store, you can see the sign that says, Visa, Mastercard, Discover, AmEx,"" she said. ""So there were visual indications of options. Those visual indications of options don't exist in this circumstance."" Apple is against the idea of allowing notice or a link to another payment system. Apple equates it to requiring Nordstrom Inc. to hang a sign in its store that Macy's Inc. has cheaper prices. Meanwhile, Epic argued it should be more like a mall being unable to prohibit a store from telling customers that another location might have less-expensive offerings. On Friday, Judge Gonzalez Rogers asked Mr. Cook: ""What is the problem with Apple giving them that option?"" --- Defining a Market Is an Essential Issue The question of how to define a market in the case is a central issue. Is the market confined to distributing apps on the iPhone as ""Fortnite"" videogame creator Epic argues? Or, as Apple contends, is the market just devices on which videogames can be played? A comment by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Friday suggests she may be looking it as an app-distribution market. ""The gaming industry seems to be generating a disproportionate amount of money relative to the [intellectual property] that you're giving them and everybody else,"" she said when questioning Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook. ""In a sense, it's almost as if they're subsidizing everybody else."" On Monday, however, she raised the notion that the market might be the mobile videogame market -- an option that neither party raised. Judge Gonzalez Rogers has also suggested on multiple occasions that she doesn't believe Apple is setting its commission of as much as 30% based on competition, but rather has made its decision arbitrarily. If she is signaling a willingness to consider some of Epic's claims, she also seems unwilling to blow up Apple's business. During her comments Monday, she expressed concern that Epic's proposals for addressing its claims against Apple went too far. ""Give me some example that has survived appellate review where the court has engaged in such a way to either prohibit something or to fundamentally change the economic model of a monopolistic company,"" Judge Gonzalez Rogers said."
Apple,Technology,15 September 2021,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,438 words",0.9909,0.076,0.021,0.903,"After weeks of turbulent headlines, Tim Cook took the virtual stage in an attempt to return attention to the key driver of Apple Inc.'s success: the iPhone. The Cupertino, Calif., tech giant revealed the iPhone 13 and a smartwatch with a new look during its annual September event, which the company streamed live on its website rather than holding in person because of Covid-19 precautions. The event caps a year in which Apple has seen record profit, largely thanks to last fall's iPhone 12, while battling opponents unhappy at the power it holds over third-party software on its mobile devices. The iPhone 13 looks similar to the previous model, and a key challenge for Mr. Cook, Apple's chief executive, is to avoid the kinds of sale drop-offs that have greeted other off-year iPhones following big hits. Some investors are worried the company's stock is overvalued, that Apple faces greater costs and that the newer phones with less dramatic changes—compared with last year's highly anticipated debut—won't fuel the same level of growth. Last year's phone marked the arrival of ultra-fast, 5G-cellular-data-capable iPhones and a new look. Apple said the iPhone 13 has a more vibrant screen, improved cameras, faster microprocessor and larger battery. The company said the regular version of its iPhone 13 will get 2.5 hours more battery life compared with the previous model. New features include a ""cinematic mode"" that allows users to capture movie-style video with greater depth using their iPhone cameras. Analysts surveyed by FactSet on average expect unit sales to fall off slightly in the next fiscal year beginning in October, while revenue is set to grow slightly—generating optimism among some that the second year of Apple offering 5G has legs. Apple said it is expanding its 5G phones to 60 countries. Similar to its iPhone 12 lineup, Apple is offering four new models ranging from the $699 iPhone 13 Mini, with a 5.4-inch screen, to the $1,099 Pro Max with a 6.7-inch screen. Starting prices didn't change from a year ago . The Pro, with a 6.1-inch screen, and larger Pro Max versions both come with higher-end camera and video systems and have optional memory upgrades to one terabyte, about twice as much as last year's biggest capacity—a feature that now adds $500. That means the most expensive version of the iPhone 13, the Pro Max, will sell for $1,599, or about $200 more than last year's $1,399 version. Apple shares were down 1.5% as the nearly 90-minute event concluded. Wringing more money out of each sale will be important for Apple if analysts are correct and unit sales fall during the next year. While the tech giant hasn't seen the incredible growth rates of iPhone devices in recent years, Mr. Cook has been able to fuel revenue growth with more expensive phones. Apple begins taking orders Friday for the four models, which will be available Sept. 24. One factor benefiting Apple in the past year—and helping to boost the appeal of pricier phones to some consumers—is cellular carriers' battles for customers for their new 5G services. The carriers have flooded the market with incentives making phones seemingly more affordable to many buyers. On Tuesday, Apple executives noted that U.S. carriers would be offering hundreds of dollars in trade-in offers. Meanwhile, Apple in the past year has seen the average selling price of its phones rise 12% to $829 this fiscal year, according to analyst estimates. AT&T Inc. announced Tuesday it will give eligible customers a free iPhone 13 Pro—which starts at $999—along with deep discounts on other versions of Apple's new flagship handset. The offer requires a traded-in device, an unlimited data plan and a three-year customer commitment, showing AT&T's focus on subsidizing customers' new smartphones in exchange for reliable service revenue. ""Maintaining the base is certainly something to speak to,"" said Jenifer Robertson, AT&T's executive vice president of mobility. ""We're retaining customers at a much higher rate."" Rivals Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. late Tuesday also offered discounts of several hundred dollars off new iPhones, among other promotions. Tuesday's event marked the first public appearance by Mr. Cook, Apple's chief executive, since a federal judge on Friday ruled largely against ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games Inc.'s attempt to undo Apple's grip. The videogame company's antitrust lawsuit had sought to allow third-party developers to bypass Apple's App Store. Instead, the judge cited the value of Apple's ecosystem to consumers, while finding that its rules prohibiting developers from steering users to alternative payment methods outside their apps went against California law and ordered it stopped. Epic is appealing , and Apple has said it is reviewing the verdict. Before the ruling, Applehad been making concessions on the so-called anti-steering provision as it worked to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by smaller developers and an investigation by Japanese authorities . Mr. Cook didn't comment on news surrounding the company during Tuesday's event. The company is on pace to finish its fiscal year this month having sold a record number of iPhones. Analysts surveyed by FactSet on average predict Apple shipped 239 million devices, which would beat the previous record of 231 million in fiscal 2015 when the first large-screen version fueled growth. Apple no longer discloses unit sales but has said device revenue rose 38% in the first three quarters of the year compared with the previous year. Analysts predict iPhone sales will finish the year 41% higher, at a record $194 billion. It is unlikely that Apple can maintain that growth next year, analysts say. In July, the company raised concerns about the industry's microprocessor shortages hindering iPhones. Sales also typically fall in the year following the first 12 months of major introductions, such as the iPhone 12. For example, after posting its previous best year for iPhone revenue in fiscal 2018 —thanks to the debut of the iPhone X, with a facial-recognition unlocking feature and a new look—device sales fell in the following two years. ""On many levels, the iPhone 12 cycle looks similar to the iPhone 6 cycle and iPhone 10 cycles,"" Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said this summer in a research note. He pointed out that Apple's stock did poorly after each cycle, falling 32% and 39% from peak to trough following the iPhone 6 and iPhone X, respectively. When asked about a potential drop-off in iPhone sales, Mr. Cook told analysts in July, ""We're in the very early innings of 5G. If you look at 5G penetration around the world, there's only a couple of countries that are in the double-digits yet. And so that's an amazing thing nine months or so into this."" Apple shares tend to reflect excitement about the iPhone. In the months ahead of the latest phone's launch in 2020, the stock doubled. So far in 2021, shares have risen nearly 13%. Before getting to the iPhones, Apple updated its lower-end iPad tablets, including a new iPad and iPad Mini, which will be priced at $329 and $499, respectively. The company also revealed its latest version of its smartwatch, the Watch Series 7, which debuts a larger screen with softer corners. The Series 7 will begin at $399 and be available later this fall. Analysts surveyed by FactSet on average expect Apple's wearables and accessories category to grow to $38.7 billion this fiscal year, compared with $10 billion in 2015 when the Watch made its debut.

Apple,Technology,1 February 2019,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,125 words",-0.9468,0.043,0.059,0.898,"Apple Inc. is flexing its power as a self-appointed privacy protector, punishing Google and Facebook Inc. over violations of its developer policies governing personal data in moves that harden battle lines over one of the technology industry's most sensitive issues. The iPhone maker on Thursday suspended internal apps used by Google employees on Apple's iOS mobile operating system, after the Alphabet Inc. unit acknowledged it had used one such app to gather data on internet use from consumers who volunteered in exchange for gift cards. That came a day after Apple took the same step against Facebook over its use of a similar data-gathering effort that also used Apple's system for companies' internal apps. Facebook said later Thursday that its apps were working again on Apple devices. Google and Apple said Thursday afternoon that they were working to restore Google apps. The penalties, while temporary, punctuated Apple's escalating campaign in recent years to highlight its purported protections of user information, in contrast to big tech rivals that Chief Executive Tim Cook has portrayed as cavalier about privacy. The Apple boss has repeatedly called for privacy legislation—an idea that many tech chiefs worry about—and has promoted Apple's business model as superior to rivals because it sells devices rather than advertising. The moves also highlight Apple's dual role as a rival to those companies and a gatekeeper controlling their access to the more than 900 million iPhones in use around the world. In one swift move, it was able to undermine the ability of two competitors to continue their daily work of updating, fixing and improving popular apps such as Instagram and Gmail, former and current employees of Facebook and Apple said. ""This is Apple flexing its muscles and part of the Tim Cook indignation tour,"" said Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University who has criticized the dominance of big tech companies. He said the privacy fight is part of jostling among the giants as their businesses increasingly collide, but he thinks ultimately the companies will reach a truce because they have too much at stake financially. Indeed, while the giants have been squaring off, they are also mutually dependent. Facebook and Google rely on Apple to distribute their apps to many of their users. Apple needs those apps because they are among the most used on iPhones. Apple also relies on Google to be the default search engine on iPhones and iPads—a service that earns it up to $9 billion a year. The latest tussle arose after a report by tech news site TechCrunch highlighted Facebook's use of a research app that offered users—including teens and young adults—$20 a month to let the company track their smartphone activity across different apps and web browsers. Apple said Facebook had distributed the app through a developer program that was designed for internal functions within companies, not for consumers, which violated Apple's policies. Facebook has said the program was standard market research and the data collection was fully disclosed to participants. Apple on Wednesday suspended use on iPhones of not only the research app but also multiple apps used by Facebook employees—such as internal versions of its Messenger, Workplace and Instagram services—disrupting their ability to communicate. Then Google on Wednesday said it had disabled Screenwise Meter, a data-collecting app that used the same Apple developer program to suck up data on internet use by consumers who volunteered in exchange for gift cards. Google apologized, saying it had been transparent with users about how their data would be used but shouldn't have used Apple's developer program. The skirmish capped off a tumultuous week in privacy after a year in which the issue drew increasing scrutiny from users, regulators and lawmakers. On Monday, Apple ran into a privacy problem of its own when a bug in its Group FaceTime video-chat function was discovered that allowed users calling another Apple user to listen in as the recipient's device rang. Apple shut down Group FaceTime and said it expected to have a patch for the problem within the week. Apple has long pushed its protection of users' information as a distinction with rivals, going back to moves by co-founder Steve Jobs that limited the amount of data and information the company collected from users on iPhones and other devices. Under Mr. Cook, Apple fought a privacy battle with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2016 over the company's refusal to comply with a government demand that it develop software to unlock a terrorist's iPhone. Mr. Cook stepped up his public championing of Apple's stance last year after Facebook admitted that its users' data were improperly obtained by Cambridge Analytica, a data-analytics firm that worked for President Trump's 2016 campaign. The Apple chief called for privacy legislation and sought to distinguish Apple's business model from Facebook and Google. ""The truth is, we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer,"" Mr. Cook said in March. ""Our products are iPhones and iPads and Macs and HomePods and the Watch, etc., and if we can convince you to buy one, we'll make a little bit of money, right? But you are not our product."" The privacy stance has frustrated rival executives who see Mr. Cook as trying to turn a philosophical difference into a marketing edge. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg called Mr. Cook's comments ""extremely glib."" ""There are companies that work hard to charge you more, and there are companies that work hard to charge you less,"" Mr. Zuckerberg told a journalist last year, alluding to the high price of Apple devices compared with the services Facebook offers free of charge. Facebook and Google pose challenges for Apple as it searches for growth in a maturing smartphone industry. Facebook's apps create a layer on top of iPhones that people can use to read news, message friends and share photos, undermining the value of the software and hardware features Apple offers in its $1,000 handsets. And Google's services such as Gmail and file storage are more widely used than similar offerings from Apple. Mr. Cook is betting the issue of privacy can help Apple, said Roger McNamee, a Bay Area venture capitalist and author of the book ""Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe."" ""Every time Tim Cook gives a speech about privacy and security, he is improving Apple's hand considerably,"" Mr. McNamee said. (""mailto:Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com"")"
Apple,EXCHANGE --- Apple vs. Facebook: What Made a Rivalry --- The tech giants discussed working together and charging a subscription fee for Facebook,13 August 2022,The Wall Street Journal,"1,629 words",0.9758,0.071,0.02,0.909,"An ongoing dispute over privacy between Apple Inc. and Facebook is roiling the digital economy, leading companies to shift billions in ad spending as users continue to limit the data available to advertisers. The feud took off last year, when Apple rolled out iOS 14.5, a version of its mobile operating system that made it easier than ever for iPhone and iPad users to opt out of letting apps like Facebook track their activity on their devices. The two companies weren't always at odds. In fact, they were almost business partners. In the years before the change, Apple suggested a series of possible arrangements that would earn the iPhone maker a slice of Facebook's revenue, according to people who either participated in the meetings or were briefed about them. As one person recalled: Apple officials said they wanted to ""build businesses together."" One idea that was discussed: creating a subscription-based version of Facebook that would be free of ads, according to people familiar with the discussions. Because Apple collects a cut of subscription revenue for apps in its App Store, that product could have generated significant revenue for the Cupertino, Calif., giant. The companies also haggled over whether Apple was entitled to a piece of Facebook's sales from so-called boosted posts, said people familiar with the matter. A boost allows a user to pay to increase the number of people that see a post on Facebook or Instagram. Facebook, which considers boosts ads, has always contended that boosts are a form of advertising, in part because they are often used by small businesses to reach a bigger audience, said one of the people. Apple, which doesn't take a cut of advertising from developers, argued that Facebook boosts should be considered in-app purchases, according to a person familiar with the matter. Apple's standard terms would entitle it to take a 30% share of those sales. Apple and Facebook, which has since changed its name to Meta Platforms Inc., didn't reach agreements on any of the proposals to work more closely together. Around the same time, Facebook was considering making its own privacy-related changes. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg chose to delay significant changes to its data practices to keep its advertising business humming, the people said, an approach internally dubbed a ""rear-guard"" strategy. The negotiations between the two companies, and Facebook's internal discussions about privacy, haven't been previously reported. They provide fresh insight into the origins of the contentious rivalry that is changing the kind of advertising consumers see online and putting billions of dollars in ad spending up for grabs. Among U.S. iPhone and iPad users, 37% have opted into allowing companies to track them on their devices, according to research firm Insider Intelligence. With so few users opting in, the ramifications of Apple's changes to its mobile operating system have been felt broadly across the digital advertising ecosystem. Among U.S. and U.K. mobile advertisers, 59% have shifted advertising budgets from iOS to Android, Google's mobile operating system, according to a June survey by Tenjin and Growth FullStack, which develop tools used by mobile advertisers. The privacy shift has resulted in $17.8 billion in lost revenue among Facebook, Twitter, Snap and YouTube so far in 2022, according to an estimate by Lotame, a data-management company. Facebook, in particular, is scrambling to patch its ad-tracking systems, after Apple's moves were the primary cause of a sharp business slump that has shaved approximately $600 billion from the company's market value in less than a year. Last month, a little more than a year after these changes, Facebook's parent company, Meta, reported its first year-over-year decline in quarterly revenue since it went public in 2012. In prominent advertising campaigns and public statements from their top executives, the two tech giants have staked out rival positions, with Apple focused on user privacy while Meta highlights the benefits of personalized online advertising. The discussions between the two companies, mostly between the years 2016 and 2018, represented efforts to find common ground in a period before their positions hardened. ""Every day, we meet and collaborate with developers of all sizes to make suggestions, address concerns, and help them continue to grow their businesses,"" said an Apple spokesman, who added that the rules for app developers like Facebook are ""applied equally to all developers because we think that fair enforcement results in the best user experience."" A Meta spokesman said the company has ""made significant changes over the past five years to protect people's data while also allowing businesses of all sizes to grow."" He continued: ""The decisions we make aren't dictated by another company, but by our commitment to the people using our products and our belief that privacy and personalization are not at odds."" Apple and Facebook for years enjoyed a unique symbiosis: Apple controlled the App Store, the gateway for hundreds of millions of users to download the flagship Facebook app as well as the company's other popular services, including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. But while Facebook's products were among the most popular apps on the iPhone, they didn't generate sales for Apple. This was a persistent frustration for some Apple executives, according to the people familiar with the matter. As the iPhone's maker, Apple also controlled device-identification tracking, which for more than a decade was central to Facebook's ability to harvest data on users and deliver personalized ads. Apple says its commitment to privacy is a core company principle that predated its rift with Facebook. An Apple spokeswoman said there is no connection between any discussions of partnerships and the ad-tracking changes that were later implemented. Apple has discussed similar business models with many developers, according to a person familiar with the conversations. The discussions with Facebook came as Apple was shifting its focus away from hardware sales and toward software. After Apple in 2016 saw its first ever year-over-year decline in iPhone revenue, CEO Tim Cook began putting more attention on the company's digital-services business. Revenue from Apple's hardware business declined nearly 1% during its most recent quarter, compared with a year earlier. Meanwhile, revenue for the company's smaller services business, which includes the App Store and its own advertising operation, rose 12%. An important part of Apple's services revenue came from a partnership with Alphabet Inc.'s Google, which wasn't publicly known until it was cited in a 2020 antitrust lawsuit against Google by the Justice Department. Under the arrangement, Google pays Apple billions of dollars annually to be the default search engine in the Safari web browser. Apple hasn't been accused of wrongdoing and Google has said it pays to promote its services just as many businesses do. Some Facebook executives worried about Apple's sway over their business, in part due to public comments by Mr. Cook that were critical of businesses that depended on collecting data about their users. Facebook's use of user data was also increasingly out of step with privacy concerns in Europe, and public stumbles prompted a wave of scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and Europe. That summer of 2018, Apple rolled out changes to its Safari desktop and mobile web browser that hindered Facebook's web business, eliminating its ability to track users without their permission as they visited different websites. The next big target for Apple: Apps doing the same kind of tracking. At Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters, Mr. Zuckerberg and his executives were already considering changes to their business, including the once-unthinkable move to stop using data collected by other companies to target ads to users, according to people familiar with the discussions. The Facebook executives who internally proposed ending the collection of third-party data argued that by ceasing its reliance on such data, the social-media giant could also reduce the company's dependence on Apple and Google's mobile operating systems. Mr. Zuckerberg opted instead to leave the bulk of its data-collection practices in place. The company shut down an ad-targeting option that relied on information collected by data brokers shortly after the Cambridge Analytica data-privacy scandal was reported in March 2018, but otherwise Facebook continued to rely on third-party data to target users with personalized ads. There were a number of reasons for rebuffing the proactive approach, according to some of the people familiar with the discussions. Some in the internal Facebook meetings believed the public would never accept Facebook as a leader in consumer-data privacy. Others worried that if Facebook gave up some of its data collection, there would be no end in sight for what practices the public would call on the company to also shut off. Some believed the hit to revenue would simply be too great. When Apple announced its changes in June 2020, it sent shock waves through the advertising industry and was hailed as a victory by advocates of data privacy. The company implemented the changes the following April. Soon thereafter, Facebook revisited the idea of a subscription version of its flagship app, said a person familiar with the discussions. A subscription-based service would have presented numerous challenges, including whether a person who uses multiple social-media accounts would have an ad-free experience for all of their accounts. Ultimately, the company decided against the idea so as to not undermine its advertising business. --- Tim Higgins and Suzanne Vranica contributed to this article."
Apple,U.S. Stocks Climb as Inflation Fears Ebb,10 May 2018,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,406 words",0.9981,0.154,0.06,0.786,"English , Inc. U.S. stocks rose Thursday and market volatility continued to fade, as fears of runaway inflation abated to help send the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher for a sixth consecutive session. The Dow rose nearly 200 points to notch its longest winning streak since February after investors got another sign that inflation may be rising, but not so rapidly that the Federal Reserve would have to take aggressive actions to keep the economy from overheating. Meanwhile, the volatility that rocked the stock market this year and sent major indexes into correction territory has gradually faded, giving some money managers hope that stocks are gaining some upward momentum. A key measure of expected market swings, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, has fallen six straight trading sessions, settling near levels that were last seen in early January, when stocks were in so-called melt-up mode following the passage of Republicans' tax overhaul. Shares of technology stocks, one of Wall Street's most popular trades, have also been gaining traction since Facebook's data mishap was revealed in March, giving investors a shot of confidence. Apple has added 15% so far this month, while Facebook and Google parent Alphabet have risen about 8%. ""We're settling in a little bit as the leadership in the market has improved,"" said Mark Lehmann, president of JMP Securities. Apple's massive gain since it reported strong earnings and disclosed plans to buy back an additional $100 billion in shares has given some investors ""real optimism about the future,"" he added.

The Dow rose nearly 200 points to notch its longest winning streak since February after investors got another sign that inflation may be rising, but not so rapidly that the Federal Reserve would have to take aggressive actions to keep the economy from overheating. Meanwhile, the volatility that rocked the stock market this year and sent major indexes into correction territory has gradually faded, giving some money managers hope that stocks are gaining upward momentum. A key measure of expected market swings, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, has fallen six straight trading sessions, settling near levels that were last seen in early January, when stocks were in so-called melt-up mode following the passage of Republicans' tax overhaul. Shares of technology stocks, one of Wall Street's most popular trades, have also been gaining traction since Facebook's data mishap was revealed in March, giving investors a shot of confidence. Apple has added 15% so far this month, while Facebook and Google parent Alphabet have risen more than 7%. ""We're settling in a little bit as the leadership in the market has improved,"" said Mark Lehmann, president of JMP Securities.

Apple,Technology,8 December 2022,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,434 words",0.9877,0.103,0.051,0.846,"Apple Inc . is planning to significantly expand its data-encryption practices, a step that is likely to create tensions with law enforcement and governments around the world as the company continues to build new privacy protections for millions of iPhone users. The expanded end-to-end encryption system, an optional feature called Advanced Data Protection, would keep most data secure that is stored in iCloud, an Apple service used by many of its users to store photos, back up their iPhones or save specific device data such as Notes and Messages. The data would be protected in the event that Apple is hacked , and it also wouldn't be accessible to law enforcement, even with a warrant. While Apple has drawn attention in the past for being unable to help agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation has drawn attention in the past for being unable to help agencies such as the access data on its encrypted iPhones , it has been able to provide much of the data stored in iCloud backups upon a valid legal request. Last year, it responded to thousands of such requests in the U.S., according to the company. With these new security enhancements, Apple would no longer have the technical ability to comply with certain law-enforcement requests such as for iCloud backups—which could include iMessage chat logs and attachments and have been used in many investigations. The company said the security enhancements, which were announced Wednesday, are designed to protect Apple customers from the most sophisticated attackers. ""As customers have put more and more of their personal information of their lives into their devices, these have become more and more the subject of attacks by advanced actors,"" said Craig Federighi , Apple 's senior vice president of software engineering, in an interview. Some of these actors are going to great lengths to get their hands on the private information of people they have targeted, he said. The FBI said it was ""deeply concerned with the threat end-to-end and user-only-access encryption pose,"" according to a statement provided by an agency spokeswoman. ""This hinders our ability to protect the American people from criminal acts ranging from cyberattacks and violence against children to drug trafficking, organized crime and terrorism,"" the statement said. The FBI and law enforcement agencies need ""lawful access by design,"" it said. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment. Former Western law-enforcement and intelligence officials said they were surprised by Apple 's decision in part because the company had refrained in the past from rolling out such encryption settings for iCloud. The officials said Apple would sometimes point authorities to the iCloud as a possible means of collecting information that could be useful for criminal investigations. Ciaran Martin , former chief of the U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre , said the announcement by Apple could pose legal complications for the company in multiple democracies that in recent years have adopted or weighed restrictions on technology that can't be responsive to law-enforcement demands. ""Things will only be clearer when further technical details are given,"" Mr. Martin said. ""But on the face of it, existing legislation in Australia and looming legislation in the U.K. would seem to give those governments the power to tell Apple in those countries effectively not to do this."" Last year, Apple proposed software for the iPhone that would identify child sexual-abuse material on the iPhone. Apple now says it has stopped development of the system, following criticism from privacy and security researchers who worried that the software could be misused by governments or hackers to gain access to sensitive information on the phone. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What do you think about Apple 's new security feature? Join the conversation below. Mr. Federighi said Apple 's focus related to protecting children has been on areas such as communication and giving parents tools to protect children in iMessage. ""Child sexual abuse can be headed off before it occurs,"" he said. ""That's where we're putting our energy going forward."" Apple released a feature in December 2021 called ""Communication Safety"" in Messages, which offers tools for parents that warn their children when they have received or attempt to send photos that contain nudity. The option is part of Apple 's ""Screen Time"" parental-controls software. The new encryption system, to be tested by early users starting Wednesday, will roll out as an option in the U.S. by year's end, and then worldwide including China in 2023, Mr. Federighi said. ""This development will prompt questions at home and abroad, including whether the government of China will really accept a loss of data access,"" said Sumon Dantiki, a former senior FBI and Justice Department official who worked on cyber investigations and is now a partner at the King & Spalding law firm. U.S. officials have long pointed to China's increasingly strict demands for access to data on companies that operate within its borders as a national-security concern. In addition to Advanced Data Protection, Apple is also modifying its Messages app to make it harder for messages to be snooped on, and it will now allow users to log in to their Apple accounts with hardware-based security keys made by other companies such as Yubico . Privacy groups have long called on Apple to strengthen encryption on its cloud servers. But because the Advanced Protection encryption keys will be controlled by users, the system will restrict Apple 's ability to restore lost data. To set up Advanced Data Protection, users will have to enable at least one data-recovery method. This could be a recovery key—a long list of numbers and characters that users could print out and store in a secure location—or the user could assign a friend or family member as a recovery contact. Over the past two decades, businesses and consumers have moved much of their data off computer systems that they control and onto the cloud—data centers filled with servers that are operated by large technology companies. That trend has made these cloud systems an attractive target for cyber intruders. Mr. Federighi said that Apple isn't aware of any customer data being taken from iCloud by hackers but that the Advanced Protection system will make things harder for them. ""All of us in the industry who manage customer data are under constant attack by entities that are attempting to breach our systems,"" he said. ""We have to stay ahead of future attacks with new protections."" As Apple has locked down its systems, governments worldwide have become increasingly interested in the data stored on phones and cloud computers. That interest has led to friction between Apple and law-enforcement agencies, along with a growing market for iPhone hacking tools. In 2020, Attorney General William Barr pressured Apple for a way to crack the iPhone's encryption to help with a terror investigation into a shooting that killed three people at a Florida Navy base. Advanced Protection will reduce the amount of iCloud information that Apple can provide to law-enforcement agencies, who frequently request iPhone data from Apple as part of their investigations. Apple received requests for information on 7,122 Apple accounts from U.S. authorities in the first six months of 2021, the last period for which the company has provided information. Apple had already offered end-to-end encryption for some of its services, but the protection will now extend to 23 services, including iPhone backups and Photos. However, three services—Mail, Contacts and Calendar—won't qualify for Advanced Protection because they use older technology protocols, Mr. Federighi said. Mr. Federighi said Apple believes it shares the same mission as law enforcement and governments: keeping people safe. If sensitive information were to get in the hands of an attacker, a foreign adversary or some other bad actor, it could be disastrous, he said. ""We're giving users the option to keep that key only on their devices, which means that even if an attacker were to successfully breach the cloud and access all that data, it would be nonsense to them,"" Mr. Federighi said. ""They'd lack the key to decrypt it.""

Apple,Epic Games Targets Core of Apple's App Store,10 May 2021,The Wall Street Journal,"1,210 words",0.0123,0.076,0.079,0.845,"In its courtroom battle with Apple Inc., Epic Games Inc. is questioning a core tenet of the iPhone maker's App Store business: that its success relies upon rigorous policing of the platform. Apple for years has said its rules and vetting process for apps protect users from malicious software and abuse, work that helps justify the up to 30% cut it takes of digital transactions there. In documents and testimony in a lawsuit being argued this month before a federal judge in Oakland, Calif., Epic has said Apple's contentions don't hold up to scrutiny. The App Store's business model, which has been called a ""walled garden"" due to the company's tight controls, faces rising criticism from a host of developers, from Spotify Technology SA to Facebook Inc. Epic and others are seeking to undermine Apple's rationale for its control of third-party software on its more than one billion iPhones, claiming the operating system is what keeps users safe, not the App Store review process. Epic contends others could safely vet apps if allowed to create their own app stores. ""To justify its walled garden, Apple needed to convince those locked in and those locked out that the wall served some higher purpose, something more than profitability -- and so Apple security justification was born,"" Katherine Forrest, an Epic lawyer, told a judge this past week during the start of the trial, expected to last most of May. Apple disputes Epic's claims that it is a monopoly and defends its app-store rules as a way to provide users with a safe, private and reliable place to download software. Apple says customers would be opened up to harm without its controls. ""Epic is here demanding that this court force Apple to let into its App Store untested and untrusted apps in app stores, which is something that Apple has never done,"" Karen Dunn, a lawyer for Apple, told the judge last week. ""Apple's unwavering commitment to safety, security, reliability, and quality does not allow that, and the antitrust laws do not require it."" The two tech companies have been at loggerheads since August, when Epic broke App Store rules by updating its ""Fortnite"" videogame with a payment system that circumvented Apple's in-app payment system. Apple responded by ejecting the game from its App Store. Epic then filed a lawsuit claiming Apple is an illegal monopoly by being the only way to distribute native apps onto iPhones and forcing developers to use its in-app payment system for all digital purchases. In its defense, Apple points to other ways that ""Fortnite"" can be distributed outside of its iPhones, such as videogame consoles, and argues that the game maker wanted to get out of paying a 30% commission for using its App Store. Epic must also convince U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers that steps Apple took around the app store weren't for legitimate competitive reasons such as providing security that benefited the customer. Expert witness testimony this coming week is expected to focus on complex technical details, including the definition of a market and security. ""Antitrust law will permit certain anticompetitive behavior"" if there is an offsetting competitive reason, said Paul Swanson, a Denver-based antitrust lawyer at Holland & Hart LLP who isn't involved in the case but is following it closely. ""There will be a big fight about whether maintaining security is a legitimate"" justification. Epic is pointing to internal company emails to suggest Apple's process had holes and prioritized efficiency over accuracy. Some of those emails show Apple managers over the years dealt with troublesome apps that appear to have gotten through the review process, including apps involving scams, phishing and inappropriate content. ""I'm dumbfounded with how this could be missed,"" Trystan Kosmynka, head of app review at Apple,wrote in May 2018 about a ""school shooting game."" Eric Friedman, who manages Apple's fraud-engineering algorithms and risk unit, lamented the inadequacies of the company's app review process on several occasions, according to internal company emails filed with the court. In an October 2013 email to a colleague, Mr. Friedman equated the review process to ""bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight""; in January 2016, he cautioned another group about expecting the process would capture a sophisticated phishing attacker. More than a year later, he told a different colleague the review team was tasked with getting apps published and keeping developers happy: ""They are more like the pretty lady who greets you with a lei at the Hawaiian airport than the drug-sniffing dog,"" he wrote. Apple says Epic's handful of colorful emails will be outmatched by its own data and witnesses that show how much safer its environment is than others. ""Each of those examples is an example of why app review is needed,"" Ms. Dunn said. Ms. Dunn said Epic should appreciate Apple's policing of apps, noting that the review process stopped a ""Fortnite"" copycat called ""FortCraft."" Apple's lawyers also tried to drive home the point that its security is an attractive feature during Epic Chief Executive Tim Sweeney 's testimony last week. On the stand, Mr. Sweeney confirmed he owned an iPhone partly because of Apple's approach to customer data security compared with competing operating systems. Apple touts its app-review process, which mixes automated and human vetting. All apps in the store are automatically screened for known malware and a team of 500 people review 100,000 apps each week. Some 40% of apps are rejected due to glitches, bugs or concerns about privacy or security, according to Apple. Epic questions why Apple has a special process for its iPhone compared with its popular laptop and desktop lines, and argues that the human review process is more concerned about Apple's business concerns than security matters. Epic's expert witness James Mickens, a computer science professor from Harvard University, is expected to take the stand this week. In court papers, he has said Apple could achieve a competitive and open distribution model by adopting the same operating system it uses for laptops. He also said iPhone security doesn't depend on the app review process. ""Apple considerably overstates the security benefits of its own centralized App Store model,"" he wrote in a court filing. Apple points to data that show malware infections on its mobile devices are a fraction compared with others. Apple's own expert witness, Aviel Rubin, a computer-science professor from Johns Hopkins University, argues in filed testimony that with more than one billion users, Apple's mobile devices face unique and heightened potential for threats. The iPhone, for example, has sensors that track a user's location as well as cameras and microphones that could be misused, and the need to prevent the phone from crashing like a computer is more critical. ""An unstable app that causes an iPhone to crash could have devastating consequences; picture, for example, an app that causes your iPhone to crash and be unable to make phone calls when you get a flat tire in the middle of the night,"" he wrote."
Apple,Technology,29 November 2022,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,284 words",-0.9822,0.068,0.1,0.831,"Elon Musk's onslaught Monday against Apple Inc. and a cornerstone of the iPhone business empire has set the stage for a potentially bruising battle between the world's richest man and the world's most valuable company. Apple and its Chief Executive Tim Cook have the ability to hold great sway over Twitter Inc.'s potential success, as the iPhone maker is a major advertiser and tightly controls the software on its App Store. In a string of tweets accusing Apple of stanching free speech and claiming that the tech giant had threatened to kick the Twitter app off the iPhone, Mr. Musk introduced a new wrinkle in Apple's efforts to maintain control over software distribution, acting as a megaphone for critics who say the company holds too much power through its App Store. By calling attention to Apple's role as a gatekeeper for the App ecosystem , Mr. Musk is picking up the mantle in the yearslong fight developers have waged against Apple and its fees. Mr. Musk could bring new focus to the company from lawmakers and regulators around the world, including politicians who have expressed concern that Silicon Valley is silencing conservative voices. Apple didn't respond to requests for comment. Mr. Musk has said he is losing $4 million a day and facing an advertiser revolt by big brands worried about the social-media company's content moderation and uncertainty at the company due to executive departures . He is trying to bolster Twitter's subscription business, making it less reliant on advertising. A new Twitter Blue , which is set to give users benefits such as identity verification for a monthly fee, has been delayed, with Mr. Musk tentatively promising it will roll out on Friday. Apple stands to collect as much as 30% of revenue from Twitter subscriptions that Mr. Musk has said are set to become a new focal point for the company. The company charges as much as 30% of app purchases or subscriptions placed through the App Store. Apple's cut of subscriptions falls to 15% after the first year of use. On Monday, Mr. Musk sent out a meme to his almost 120 million followers that showed a car careening toward an off-ramp that read, ""Go to War."" The car, pulling off a road labeled ""Pay 30%,"" represented Mr. Musk. Mr. Musk, who became the world's richest man with his stakes in Tesla Inc. and rocket company SpaceX, has a long history of defiance and fighting publicly with those whom he perceives as threatening his interests and views. He has taken jabs not just at rivals but also at the likes of President Biden and the Securities and Exchange Commission. This battle may be different. Under Mr. Cook, Apple has kicked apps off the store over content-moderation concerns and has blocked certain social media data-collection practices in the name of user privacy. The dispute could draw new attention to how speech is monitored on the internet and to Apple's power as an arbiter of what software is allowed to reach its more than 1 billion iPhone users. In Apple's App Store review guidelines, one of the earliest warnings the company makes is that apps ""should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy."" ""It just looks like Elon wants to pick a fight with Apple,"" said Phillip Shoemaker, former senior director of the App Store Review team at Apple, who left in 2016. ""But I can't imagine him winning this one."" When he oversaw App Store content, Mr. Shoemaker said Apple would tell app developers what they were in violation of before threatening to remove an app. Typically, he said, software makers were given two weeks to fix an issue such as content moderation before it began to reject app updates and eventually pull it from the digital store. Questions from experts about Twitter's ability to moderate content on the platform began to surface as Mr. Musk fired about half of the company's workers and pushed many more to leave. ""When Elon comes out and fires the whole moderation team, the first thing I said is that Twitter is going to get kicked off the App Store,"" Mr. Shoemaker said. Mr. Musk has said he was motivated to buy Twitter to ensure it remained a platform for free speech, and he has also said he would abide by local laws related to content. Mr. Musk completed his takeover of the social-media company last month in a deal valued at $44 billion . After he completed his takeover about a month ago, several outside groups including the Anti-Defamation League and the Network Contagion Research Institute said they had documented a sudden rise in hate speech on the platform. The ADL, a Jewish advocacy group that examines anti-Semitism in the U.S., said it identified more than 1,200 tweets and retweets spreading anti-Semitic memes and called it ""a coordinated effort"" that followed Mr. Musk's takeover. Yoel Roth, then the head of trust and safety at Twitter, said in late October that a small number of accounts were behind many of the tweets of slurs or hateful content. On Nov. 9, he said the company had succeeded in reducing the number of times hate speech had been seen. He left Twitter soon afterward and said in a New York Times opinion article that advertisers, governments and companies such as Apple and Google ultimately hold significant sway over Twitter's content. Failing to follow Apple or Google's content guidelines could be ""catastrophic"" for Twitter, he wrote. Mr. Musk has said the amount of hate speech seen on Twitter has fallen significantly. ""Hate speech impressions down by 1/3 from pre-spike levels,"" he said Nov. 23. About two years ago, Apple removed the social-media app Parler over concerns it wasn't doing enough to moderate dangerous content. That decision, which was joined by the likes of Alphabet Inc.'s Google, helped put Apple in the crosshairs of conservative lawmakers in Washington, D.C., worried about the power held by Silicon Valley companies. Mr. Musk criticized Apple after the company faced a legal battle in 2021 with developers and ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games Inc. over the control the iPhone maker holds over software. Epic has accused Apple of holding an improper monopoly over the distribution of third-party apps onto the iPhone and forcing those software companies to use its in-app payment system. Epic has called Apple's 30% take unfair. Apple has defended its business, saying the fees are in line with the industry norm and fair for the technology it provides. It mostly won a lawsuit by Epic, though the two are continuing to fight in an appeals court. Mr. Musk waded into the matter more than a year ago, before his interest to own Twitter was clear. ""Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet,"" Mr. Musk tweeted in July 2021. ""Epic is right."" Apple keeps a close eye on what software makers say and, according to documents that emerged in the Epic trial, had warned app developers about taking their grievances public, aiming to settle disagreements in private. and Aaron Tilley at aaron.tilley@wsj.com Elon Musk's Apple Attack Sets Stage for Public Spat With Risks for Apple, Twitter (""https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-apple-attack-sets-stage-for-public-spat-with-risks-for-apple-twitter-11669696416"")"
Apple,Tech,10 May 2018,The Wall Street Journal Online,866 words,0.996,0.111,0.039,0.85,"Apple Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are preparing to launch a new joint credit card, a move that would deepen the technology giant's push into its customers' wallets and mark the Wall Street firm's first foray into plastic. The planned card would carry the Apple Pay brand and could launch early next year, people familiar with the matter said. Apple will replace its longstanding rewards-card partnership with Barclays PLC, the people said. The Apple-Goldman card could help the companies combat weaknesses in their core businesses. As new iPhone sales growth slows, Apple is focusing on services such as mobile payments, streaming-music subscriptions, and App Store sales. Apple Pay, which generates revenue on each transaction, is a key contributor, but adoption has been slower than executives hoped. Goldman, meanwhile, is pushing into consumer banking to compensate for a slump in securities-trading, where revenue has fallen by two-thirds since the financial crisis. It launched a retail banking business called Marcus in 2016 for online savings accounts and personal loans, and executives have been exploring adding credit cards and wealth-management tools. The partnership will extend into other services including Goldman offering in-store loans to Apple customers buying iPhones and other gadgets, an effort The Wall Street Journal reported on in February. Apple and Goldman are still hashing out the terms and benefits of the planned card including the perks for customers, these people said. The current Apple credit card with Barclays offers interest-free financing on Apple devices and points toward Apple gift cards. Apple, Goldman and Barclays declined to comment. The Apple Pay card is the latest example of a technology giant broadening its presence in the banking and finance industry. Besides Apple, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Samsung Electronics Co. are all vying to make mobile payments easier for consumers while adding to their formidable revenue streams. Goldman has the potential to raise Apple Pay's profile, tying the mobile payment service to plastic touted in advertising and pushed by cashiers at Apple stores. Apple also stands to boost its revenue by collecting a bounty from Goldman for each new cardholder, the people said. These payments, which are common in store-brand cards, can exceed $100 per account. With the Barclays card, Apple declined to collect bounties and instead put that money toward interest-free financing of devices. Additionally, Apple could take a larger cut of mobile payments from the card if it is used for purchases, the person said. Currently, when a consumer pays for a purchase using the digital wallet on the iPhone—regardless of what credit card the customer charges—Apple receives 0.15% per transaction. Apple could more than double that under the agreement with Goldman, one of the people said. The additional revenue could help Apple as it pursues a goal of doubling its services business to about $50 billion annually by 2020 from $24.35 billion in 2016. But as Apple shifts from a Barclays card that encourages device sales with interest-free financing to a card designed to boost Apple Pay, the challenge could be driving enough of an uptick in mobile payments to offset any decline of high-price iPhones, iPads or Macs. For Goldman, the card could help its nascent retail-banking operation, launched in 2016, add new customers who may be sold other banking products. It also deepens the firm's ties to Apple, a company its bankers have advised in deals and fundraisings for years. Without branches or a well-known Main Street brand, Goldman has relied on referrals, and pays for customer leads from firms including tax-preparation software maker Intuit Inc. and personal-finance website Credit Karma Inc. Last month it bought personal-finance app Clarity Money, gaining access to its roughly one million users.​ Still, the push into credit cards is fraught for Goldman, whose track record in consumer finance is scarcely two-years old. Credit cards are a cutthroat business dominated by larger rivals like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. Yields are falling. And Goldman lacks much of the infrastructure to be able to issue credit cards and process payments to merchants. And after marketing its Marcus products in part by criticizing credit-card fees and high interest rates, its entry into that business may invite criticism from consumer advocates and regulators. It is unclear which card network—Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. or Discover Financial Services—will process transactions for the new card. Apple has had a longstanding relationship with Visa, which is based in San Francisco. Barclaycard executives managing the Apple account met at the tech giant's Cupertino, Calif., office in recent weeks to determine whether the account—one of its most high profile—would be extended, a person familiar with the meeting said. The bank began issuing the Apple credit card in 2005. AnnaMaria Andriotis contributed to this article. and Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com (""mailto:liz.hoffman@wsj.com"")"
Apple,Technology,12 September 2021,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,192 words",0.9865,0.11,0.068,0.822,"Apple Inc. scored a partial victory Friday in a landmark antitrust case, but its fight with opponents of the App Store is far from over. While U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers left in place many of Apple's restrictions for third-party software, she raised the specter of the tech company nearing a point where it could be deemed a monopoly in the mobile videogame market. The warning was tucked inside her 180-page ruling Friday, which was broadly greeted by Apple as a resounding victory. Still, the judge's findings included criticism of its business as well as requirements that it stop prohibiting software developers from informing users of alternative payment methods outside their apps. Her decision will be scrutinized by lawmakers, regulators and rivals around the world as they look at ways to rein in the power held by Big Tech and protect digital marketplaces. Rivals pointed to the decision as proof that antitrust laws need to be updated for a new era. ""What today's ruling…makes clear is that antiquated antitrust laws cannot solely be fixed by the courts,"" said Match Group Inc., the online dating company. Lawmakers in Congress and Europe have been working on legislation that would have ramifications for Apple's business. South Korean legislators recently passed a law that would prohibit Apple's in-app payment system, which was at the heart of the complaint from Epic Games Inc., the maker of the ""Fortnite"" videogame. The Justice Department has also been looking at Apple's App Store, but legal scholars have been saying it would be hard to move ahead with any possible case if a strong ruling by a powerful judge endorsed Apple's practices. When the trial in Oakland, Calif., began in May, the first big challenge for Epic was to define the market in question. In a blow to the company, the judge ultimately rejected its claim that Apple improperly controlled distribution of apps onto the iPhone and forced use of its in-app payment system. Instead, she zeroed in on the power Apple holds over the mobile game market, cautioning that a market share of more than 55% wasn't yet high enough to sustain a monopoly case. ""The court cannot conclude that Apple's market power reaches the status of monopoly power in the mobile gaming market,"" she wrote. ""That said, the evidence does suggest that Apple is near the precipice of substantial market power, or monopoly power, with its considerable market share."" That language was seen by some legal observers as a yellow flag of caution to Apple. ""I think the battle continues for Apple,"" said Sam Weinstein, a law professor at Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University and a former antitrust lawyer for the Justice Department who has been following legal challenges to how Apple runs its business. The judge's language, he said, suggests that ""on another day with more facts, a couple of years down the line, maybe Apple loses."" Nick Rodelli, head of CFRA's Legal Edge Research, said in a note to clients that Apple still faces risk, adding that the ruling provided road maps for a Federal Trade Commission unfair-business-practices case and potentially other developer lawsuits. Shares of Apple fell 3.3% on Friday. The Epic lawsuit threatened a key component of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook's strategy for expanding revenue beyond the sale of iPhones and other pieces of hardware. The App Store has grown to be a significant part of the company's profit engine. The judge said game revenue generated by less than 10% of the programs in the App Store account for 70% of its revenue. Most apps are free. The judge concluded that Apple was saved by the fact that its market share wasn't higher, that rivals had been making inroads into the mobile game space and that Epic hadn't focused on the topic with its case. ""While the court finds that Apple enjoys considerable market share of over 55% and extraordinarily high profit margins, these factors alone do not show antitrust conduct,"" the judge wrote. ""Success is not illegal."" Apple General Counsel Katherine Adams told reporters shortly after the verdict: ""This is a resounding victory and underscores the merit of our business both as an economic and competitive engine."" She added that the company was still reviewing the results. Early in the case, the judge acknowledged that no matter how she ruled, the decision would likely be appealed in a process that could likely take years to resolve. Apple on Friday was coy about its next step, while Epic told the court Sunday it plans to appeal. Tim Sweeney, co-founder and chief executive of Epic, seemed eager to continue his battle. In a tweet , he wrote, ""We will fight on."" One area for possible appeal by Apple involves how the judge arrived at her decision to loosen some restrictions on the App Store. She ruled that Apple was violating California law by prohibiting developers from telling users that they could go outside the app to make purchases, possibly saving money. She ordered that Apple stop that practice nationwide in 90 days. ""A nationwide injunction of this scope raises difficult questions and is ripe for appeal, particularly on the heels of so much analysis vindicating Apple's business model,"" said Paul Swanson, a Denver-based antitrust lawyer at Holland & Hart LLP who followed the case. Some think the judge's use of California's Unfair Competition Law, which is a broader statute than traditional antitrust approaches, to penalize the company could have expansive impacts on Apple, opening it up to further challenges. ""We see the use of UCL against Apple bolstering the FTC's stated objective of reinterpreting its own comparable statute—the prohibition on 'unfair methods of competition,'"" Robert Kaminski, who heads the telecommunications, media and technology policy research practice at Capital Alpha Partners LLC, an investor-focused policy-research firm, wrote in a note. Even before Friday's injunction against Apple's so-called antisteering provision, the company had been loosening rules around the matter to resolve other legal battles it faced. It is unclear how Apple's revenue might be affected if users can more easily access apps' websites for payments to get around the iPhone maker's collection of as much as 30% of what is spent.

A 3% drop for Apple competitor Samsung Electronics Co. helped drag the South Korean Kospi down 0.8%. U.S. futures put the Nasdaq Composite, also heavily weighted toward information technology companies, down 2.6%, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average on course to slide 1.4% at the opening bell. Apple--the world's most valuable company by market capitalization--slashed its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than 15 years Wednesday, in a move prompted by ebbing iPhone sales in China. A signal of economic gloom in the world's second largest economy, Apple's move followed a batch of pessimistic sentiment indicators earlier in the week. ""Apple's warning over slowing growth in China has further heightened investors' concerns over the slowing global growth outlook,"" said Fritz Louw, currency analyst at MUFG in a note. The U.S. dollar plunged 3.7% against the Japanese yen after Apple's forecast cut, although that fall had last softened to 1.2%.

Apple,Apple Privacy Rules Give It an Edge,28 April 2021,The Wall Street Journal,"1,005 words",0.9531,0.072,0.048,0.88,"Under Apple Inc.'s new privacy restrictions, advertisers targeting iPhone users will get more data about ad performance if they buy Apple's ad space than if they buy through third parties, according to ad-industry executives. The difference could eventually give Apple's small but growing ad business an edge over rivals, ad executives and app makers say. Apple's latest operating system for iPhones has set off a firestorm in the ad industry and beyond by letting users decide whether to let apps track them for advertising purposes -- changes that mean companies may soon have less data about who sees their ads. Apps on Apple's iOS platform must ask users' permission to track them for advertising purposes. When targeting users who have opted out of tracking, advertisers who buy ads through third-party platforms will have to wait three days for insights on their campaigns and will receive only aggregate information, such as the total number of users who took an action after an ad, people familiar with Apple's ad products said. Advertisers who buy Apple ad space can receive more data about user behavior, the people said. They can learn which version of their ads users saw and which search keywords ads appeared on, they said. Those advertisers will get results nearly in real time, the people said. That could give Apple an edge in luring advertisers, especially if the tech company expands its ad business, ad-industry executives say. Right now, Apple sells search ads that appear in its App Store and display ads that appear in its News and Stocks apps. An Apple spokesman denied that the company is advantaging its own products and said the data restrictions for ads bought on third-party platforms are needed because some advertisers could use that information to circumvent Apple's privacy rules and track individual users. Apple's own ad products can't be exploited in the same way, the company said, because advertisers on its platforms can only target large groups of people. Apple's advertising business consists primarily of search ads on its app store, which won't be affected by the coming privacy restrictions. Those ad placements mostly appeal to a relatively small subset of advertisers: app makers, which can bid to appear atop search results. Apple's app-store advertising is expected to bring in about $2 billion this fiscal year, according to an estimate from Cowen & Co. Last fiscal year, Apple's total revenue was $274.52 billion. By comparison, Facebook Inc. reported $84.17 billion in ad revenue last year. Apple is planning to expand its ad offerings and is testing a new ad slot that will be available in the App Store's ""suggested"" category, which could be targeted based on users' interest and audience data, the people familiar with Apple's ad products said. The Financial Times earlier reported on Apple's planned ad slot. Even without more ad space to sell, Apple could fetch higher ad prices if demand for its ad space rises as a result of the privacy changes, ad executives said. Eric Seufert, an analyst and marketing-strategy consultant, criticized Apple's plan, saying detailed data on ads' performance is valuable to marketers. ""So it's not really clear why they would withhold it from"" advertisers buying through other ad sellers, he said, ""unless they were just really trying to privilege their own ad networks."" Apple said the technologies behind its new privacy restrictions are ""designed to help developers implement safe advertising practices and protect users -- not to advantage Apple."" Facebook, app publishers and ad-tech companies have also criticized the changes. In March, France's competition regulator rejected advertisers' push to halt Apple's software update. The regulator is reviewing whether Apple applied less stringent data-use rules to itself than to other services, and has promised a final ruling by early next year. Apple said it was looking forward to further engagement with France's competition regulator on the matter. ""We firmly believe that users' data belongs to them, and that they should control when that data is shared, and with whom,"" the company said. Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, said critics will struggle to argue that Apple's privacy rules violate antitrust laws, since the company says it is motivated by privacy concerns and offers users a choice of whether or not to accept tracking. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services. Ad executives say Apple could become a big player in the $400 billion global digital-ad industry. The company has gone down that road before. It bid in 2009 on AdMob Inc., a specialist in brokering ad sales on mobile phones, but was beat out by Google. Apple in 2010 launched its own ad network, iAd, which facilitated ad sales in iPhone apps. The business failed to catch on, and Apple shut it in 2016. ""Apple basically almost recused themselves from the advertising ecosystem a number of years ago because it was too small, and they had a perception that it was going to damage the brand of their hardware business,"" said Chad Engelgau, chief executive officer of Acxiom, the data unit owned by ad-agency holding company Interpublic Group of Cos. ""They are absolutely investing in the advertising business going forward,"" he said. ""They have a level of control, being a hardware manufacturer, being a content provider."" In 2018 Apple sought to expand its digital-advertising business, and met with major apps including Snap Inc. and Pinterest Inc. about participating in an Apple network that would distribute ads across a network of participating apps. Competing with Google and Facebook on ads that appear in mobile-phone apps wouldn't be easy. Google and Facebook dominated, in part, because of their detailed data on users. Apple has criticized extensive use of data for advertising."
Apple,Technology,11 January 2019,The Wall Street Journal,814 words,0.9957,0.098,0.025,0.877,"Apple is making a small but radical shift in its corporate strategy. The company is blasting holes in the boundaries of its staunchly defended walled garden. For years, a big part of Apple's premium experience -- and justification for its premium pricing -- has been that its software and services are only available on its hardware. At this year's CES tech show in Las Vegas, it's become apparent that the company is ready to try something different. Samsung announced Monday that Apple's iTunes software -- and the video library it lets people make purchases from -- will be available on its smart TVs. In addition, these TVs will support AirPlay 2, Apple's wireless standard that allows Apple's iPhones and other devices to stream content directly to those TVs. That was followed by a flurry of AirPlay 2 announcements from other TV makers including LG, Vizio and Sony. In December, Amazon said Apple Music was coming to Echo speakers. An acute Apple observer might ask: What about Apple TV? What about the HomePod? They appear to be left dangling in the wind, with less to differentiate themselves from these more popular devices -- which even Apple's most loyal customers might already own. While the company did port iTunes to Windows in 2003, which helped the nascent service and the iPod take off, this strategy is mostly alien to Apple. But it's familiar to Google (you don't need an Android phone to use Gmail), Amazon (you don't need a Kindle to read Amazon's e-books) and even -- more recently -- Microsoft. Steve Ballmer's reign was characterized by a Windows-everywhere strategy in which the bulk of Microsoft's offerings had to both run on and support the company's core OS. Under Satya Nadella, the company has been characterized by rapid strides to get Microsoft's services onto every device possible, not least of all those running an OS from Apple or Google. Apple is hardly the first giant company that tried to control every part of its ecosystem -- Microsoft and Sony come to mind. The strategy works until it doesn't. As Apple stumbles in China and is beset by a winter for smartphone sales, opening up may not merely be a means of maintaining Apple's growth but ultimately its survival. ""In a way, this is a little bit of Apple playing defense,"" says tech analyst Patrick Moorhead. Not everyone is going to pony up extra for Apple's branded entertainment devices, he adds, so it's instead betting that wider availability will boost overall subscriptions. A move by Apple to decouple sales of hardware from services revenue couldn't come sooner. The company's stock tumbled after it admitted a rare and significant miss on revenue, which Chief Executive Tim Cook attributed mostly to slumping sales in China. However, the company also restated its growth in its services business: It's up 18% from a year ago, but analysts had expected it to rise 24%. The timing of Apple's recent sales miss might seem suspiciously related to the push onto competitors' devices, but hardware and software integration deals like these can take years, says Mr. Moorhead. For instance, it dropped the requirement that devices have a special, Apple-certified chip in them to support AirPlay 2, the company's streaming media protocol. This led to the latest adoption by a handful of top TV brands. It isn't a true content partnership, but saying something like, ""Hey Siri, play 'Mission Impossible: Fallout' on the Vizio TV"" would now be possible. The Samsung deal is deeper: It includes an app that lets users in over 100 countries download and play Apple iTunes movies and TV shows. And it isn't just for new sets -- a firmware update will bring the app to 2018 Samsung TV models as well. Apple may dominate sales of high-end smartphones in the U.S., but for the rest of the world Android is the norm. ""This could give the other three-quarters of the world the first taste [of Apple] they may have ever gotten,"" says Mr. Moorhead. All of this makes even more sense if the reports that Apple is working on a Netflix-style streaming service prove true. For Apple to get enough sign-ups for such a service, it must look beyond Apple TV. Its market share is anemic: only 15% of the U.S. installed base of media streaming devices. While Apple's strategy of porting its services could help the company in the long term, there is one way in which it's potentially ominous: To the extent that Apple is now copying the strategies of -- and in some ways leaning on -- its competitors, it's worth asking whether the company is running low on ideas."
Apple,Technology,14 December 2018,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,097 words",0.9966,0.096,0.008,0.895,"Apple Inc.'s plan to add thousands of jobs in Austin, Texas, San Diego, Seattle and Culver City, Calif., draws a road map of its transformation away from its identity as an iPhone maker toward a future reliant on services and higher-priced devices. Each location where it announced expansion plans Thursday reflects a different facet of Apple's evolving model. Culver City gives Apple a Hollywood homebase as it pushes into video programming. Seattle is a machine-learning hub where it can develop algorithms that personalize streaming-music playlists and improve Siri. San Diego and Austin offer semiconductor engineers who can advance the customized-chip efforts that help Apple wring more money out of its iPhones, iPads and Macs. The mix of software and services and higher prices are key to Apple's effort to offset slowing iPhone unit sales. Though the company reported record annual revenue on Nov. 1 due to higher iPhone prices, it also said it would stop reporting the number of iPhones sold —a metric that has been stagnant lately—a decision that many analysts interpreted as signaling the iPhone's growth years are in the past. Apple's stock price has declined by nearly a quarter since then. While the push beyond its Silicon Valley home could aid those efforts, it also will test a highly centralized company that has thrived due to a concentrated workforce located near its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, analysts said. ""This idea of 'Designed in Cupertino' has really been the ethos of Apple, and now you're going to have AI and services designed outside Cupertino,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner at investment and research firm Loup Ventures. ""It's a shift that adds complexity to the culture."" Co-founder Steve Jobs wanted as many employees near headquarters as possible to speed decision making and foster a strong culture. He inspired Apple's new $5 billion campus with its 2.8-million-square-foot circular building, believing that bringing Apple's diffused staff under one roof would improve the exchange of ideas. Apple's workforce has exploded to about 132,000 employees from 16,000 before the iPhone's debut. Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst with Creative Strategies, said she has visited Apple offices in London and Beijing and found they feel like headquarters. She expects offices from San Diego to Seattle will be the same way. ""It might be you don't get the Silicon Valley vibe,"" Ms. Milanesi said. But she said, ""It's a culture thing and not a location issue."" As a company focused on selling devices, Apple over the past decade created millions of low-end manufacturing jobs in China at the contractors who assemble its gadgets. While such assembly jobs aren't likely to return to the U.S., Apple has increasingly emphasized adding other types of workers at home. On Thursday, Apple said it would add 1,000 jobs apiece in Culver City, Seattle and San Diego. It will invest $1 billion in a new Austin campus for 5,000 employees—its second there. Apple and other big tech companies have sought to show they are creating American jobs as their clout has grown. President Trump, who has pressured Apple to bring home manufacturing jobs from Asia, tweeted his gratitude Friday to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook ""for agreeing to expand operations in the U.S. and thereby creating thousands of jobs!"" Aside from the political goodwill, the job expansion outside Silicon Valley could help Apple diversify beyond the iPhone. Culver City is expected to be the base of a Hollywood operation to which Apple last year allocated an initial $1 billion for developing programming and poaching top talent. In January, the company leased 128,000 square feet of office and retail space in the Los Angeles-area town, which is home to Sony Pictures Entertainment and its Culver Studios, where classics like ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Gone With the Wind"" were made. The additions in Seattle promise to deepen Apple's presence in a hub for machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence. Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., along with the University of Washington and Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, have helped draw leading AI scientists to the area. Apple pushed into Seattle's machine-learning community with the 2016 acquisition of Turi Inc., a startup led by a University of Washington professor, and has kept its operations there. Machine learning is critical to personalizing software services, said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group LLC, a Seattle venture firm. It helps Spotify Technology SA suggest songs that listeners might like and aids Amazon's Alexa in fielding queries, he said. ""The two layers of the cake that are ubiquitously important for all apps and services are cloud computing and data science,"" Mr. McIlwain said. ""Apple's got to come to terms with that."" Traditionally, gadget makers like Apple have bought chips made by other companies. But in the past decade, Apple has expanded its semiconductor efforts to include the Bluetooth chip that powers AirPods and graphics processors for the iPhone. Its efforts helped enable the facial-recognition technology that it introduced with last year's iPhones, a feature that helped justify raising the starting price of the iPhone X by more than 50% to $999. Apple has added jobs in Austin, where it agreed to build its first campus in 2012, to support those efforts over time. Related Coverage * Apple Plans Billion-Dollar Austin Campus in Wave of New Sites * A 'Slacker' No More, Austin Emerges as High-Tech Hub The San Diego area and Southern California, meanwhile, have been the hub for two of the key developers of communications chips: Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom. Apple can poach engineering talent from those two companies and potentially push into their areas of expertise, developing its own modem and radio-frequency chips, said Robert Maire, president of Semiconductor Advisors, which advises on chip-related transactions. ""If you're doing chip design, that would be the place to be,"" Mr. Maire said of San Diego. Developing a modem chip would also ease Apple's dependency on Qualcomm, he said. Apple sued the chip supplier nearly two years ago over what it called unfair licensing practices, and has been in a bitter legal battle with the company since then. (""mailto:Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com"")"
Apple,Apple Retail Chief Plans to Step Down,6 February 2019,The Wall Street Journal,933 words,0.9937,0.095,0.036,0.869,"Corrections & Amplifications Apple Inc. executive Deirdre O'Brien joined the company in 1988; she hasn't worked at International Business Machines Corp. In some editions Wednesday, a Page One article about the departure of Angela Ahrendts from Apple incorrectly said Ms. O'Brien has been at Apple since 1998, and in other editions it incorrectly called her a former IBM executive. (WSJ February 7, 2019) (END) Apple Inc. said that its retail chief, Angela Ahrendts, is leaving the company and will be succeeded by a longtime operations executive who now runs human resources, a move that comes as the tech giant wrestles with flagging iPhone sales. Ms. Ahrendts, one of Apple's most highly paid executives and most prominent female leaders, joined the company from fashion house Burberry Group PLC and was charged with revamping Apple's stores and improving employee morale. During Apple's most profitable run, Ms. Ahrendts presided over a sizable retail expansion that punctuated the company's luxury-brand appeal and, close observers say she was a capable caretaker of Apple's successful retail strategy but that little changed radically under her tenure. ""She doesn't seem to have given the retail experience any forward-leaning point of view,"" said Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. ""Though they made some noise about creating a community center out of the store, I don't think that had any traction."" Ms. Ahrendts had enjoyed the support of Apple's board over the years and had been viewed as a potential successor to Chief Executive Tim Cook, people close to the board said. Apple doesn't disclose its store sales, but the company's wider business has faced pressure from investors to reignite iPhone sales, which have been disappointing. The company's iPhones sales declined 15% to $51.98 billion during the three months ended in December, the company's biggest sales period. In January, Mr. Cook expressed disappointment about a decline in customers visiting Apple Stores in China as the economy has slowed there. Ms. Ahrendts, 58 years old, will be leaving Apple in April, the company said Tuesday, ""for new personal and professional pursuits."" Ms. Ahrendts plans to travel with her husband, according to a person familiar with her thinking. Succeeding her is Deirdre O'Brien, the company's vice president of people who has been at Apple since 1998. Although Ms. O'Brien is in charge of the company's human-resources functions, the longtime Apple executive has also handled roles that dovetail with her new retail position, including demand forecasting. Ms. O'Brien will be tasked with running Apple's more than 500 stores on five continents and several online sales channels. She will continue to oversee human resources, talent development and employee relations and will focus ""on the connection between the customer and the people and processes that serve them,"" Apple said. ""The last five years have been the most stimulating, challenging and fulfilling of my career,"" Ms. Ahrendts said in a statement. ""Through the teams' collective efforts, Retail has never been stronger or better positioned to make an even greater contribution for Apple."" Apple hired Ms. Ahrendts in October 2013 after a yearlong search, from her job as chief executive at British luxury-goods company Burberry. During her tenure there since 2006, Ms. Ahrendts more than tripled sales and quadrupled the company's share price. Ms. Ahrendts, an Indiana native, broke ground as one of the few women in Apple's executive ranks. At the time of her hiring, Apple's stores were seen as stale, and other retailers were copying its format of brightly lighted open-plan places. In 2013, sales at Apple stores had fallen, year over year, in the June quarter for the first time in four years. Apple no longer breaks down its retail business in its financial reports, but in 2012 retail sales accounted for 12% of total revenue. Ms. Ahrendts pushed for flagship stores in Seoul, Thailand and other locales outside North American and European markets. She also championed the idea of refashioning Apple stores as ""town squares,"" gathering places in local communities where people could work with Apple's staff to learn how to better use their iPhones, iPads, Macs and other products. Ms. Ahrendts is among the highest-paid executives in the retail industry, earning more last year than the heads of many retail chains. She received $26.5 million in total compensation last year from Apple, which included a $21.5 million stock award -- nearly twice as much as Mr. Cook. During her tenure at Apple, Ms. Ahrendts's compensation totaled $172.8 million, including stock awards, according to company proxy statements. After joining the firm she was granted a signing bonus of more than 113,000 units of restricted stock, then valued at about $68 million. Because of their high-profile locations and role as product-demonstration spaces, Apple's stores have an outsize effect on the company's bottom line, said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. ""It's more important than the revenue would indicate.""

Apple,Apple Countersues Over 'Fortnite',9 September 2020,The Wall Street Journal,892 words,-0.336,0.055,0.068,0.877,"Apple Inc. swung back hard at Epic Games Inc. in a counter-lawsuit, accusing the software developer of duplicity and greed in an intensifying legal battle over the iPhone maker's online software store that could reshape how the marketplace operates. At the core of the dispute is how much control Apple exerts in the expansive world of smartphone apps that have changed how modern life operates and ushered in the platforms for everything from home entertainment and videogames to on-demand food ordering and ride hailing. Epic sued Apple and Google in August after the tech giants yanked the popular ""Fortnite"" videogame from their app marketplaces, calling the power both companies hold over developers as monopolistic. Apple and Google removed the game after Epic introduced an in-app payment system in violation of their rules that would cut out both companies from receiving a 30% share of users' spending. In court records filed on Tuesday, Apple defended its actions and went further, asking a federal judge in California to award punitive damages and restrict Epic from continuing what it describes as unfair business practices. ""Epic's lawsuit is nothing more than a basic disagreement over money,"" Apple said in its filing on Tuesday. ""Although Epic portrays itself as a modern corporate Robin Hood, in reality it is a multibillion-dollar enterprise that simply wants to pay nothing for the tremendous value it derives from the App Store."" An Epic spokesman declined to comment beyond what the company has said before about fighting what it describes as a system that suppresses competition and inflates prices. While Epic and Apple seek to litigate their dispute, the game maker on Friday filed a motion arguing to get ""Fortnite"" back in the App Store while that fight drags on. A hearing is scheduled for Sept. 28. ""All Epic seeks is for the court to stop Apple from retaliating against Epic for daring to challenge Apple's misconduct,"" Epic said in last week's filing. Closely held Epic is just the latest company to take issue with Apple's control of the App Store, which is part of the Cupertino, Calif., company's evolution to expand beyond selling hardware and to generate revenue from software services. Apple's App Store in the first seven months of this year generated nearly $39 billion in global revenue from in-app purchases, subscriptions and premium apps, according to researcher Sensor Tower. After its launch in 2008, the App Store has about one billion customers from 175 countries. Apple is facing antitrust probes from governments in the U.S. and Europe while other tech companies from Microsoft Corp. to Spotify Technology SA have joined in complaining about app marketplace practices. In August, Facebook Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a webcast with employees that Apple has the ability to block innovation and ""to charge monopoly rents,"" a person familiar with the matter said. Apple hasn't commented on Mr. Zuckerberg's remarks. In response to regulatory probes Apple has denied hurting rivals and said it wants apps that compete with its services to thrive. In Tuesday's filing, Apple worked to paint itself as the victim to Epic's plotting, describing all of the help it had given Epic in recent years before the game company allegedly laid the groundwork for its ""calculated and pre-packaged campaign"" against the tech giant. ""Fortnite"" has been downloaded almost 130 million times since being added to the App Store in 2018, Apple said. Epic has earned more than $600 million from its relationship with Apple, court records said. Epic Chief Executive Tim Sweeney in late June emailed Apple executives, including CEO Tim Cook, asking for a special agreement exempting his company from existing contractual obligations, including the App Store payments, according to Apple's filing. It was a demand Apple rejected. On Aug. 3, Epic sent to the App Store an update of ""Fortnite"" that the game company described as a ""hotfix"" but, in fact, Apple claimed was a Trojan horse allowing it to bypass Apple's review process and payment system. At around 2 a.m. on Aug. 3, Mr. Sweeney emailed Apple again. ""Epic will no longer adhere to Apple's payment processing restrictions,"" he wrote, according to the filing. Mr. Sweeney declined to comment when asked about Apple's latest filing. A few hours later, Apple said, Epic activated the external payment workaround that cut Apple out of its share of sales. ""Epic sought to enjoy all of the benefits of Apple's iOS platform and related services while its 'hotfix' lined Epic's pockets at Apple's expense,"" Apple said in its filing. That was followed by a public-relations battle and lawsuit against Apple. Apple has defended its take of app purchases as a way to help fund the development of its ecosystem that provides a safe and secure way to download third-party software. It noted in the new filing that Apple requires every app on its system to undergo a ""rigorous, human-assisted review."" It noted that Epic has its own app marketplace where it charges a commission as well, though Epic takes only a 12% cut of sales. ""There is nothing anticompetitive about charging a commission for others to use one's service,"" Apple said in the filing."
Apple,Technology,3 May 2021,The Wall Street Journal,789 words,0.9618,0.07,0.039,0.89,"Epic Games Inc.'s antitrust case against Apple Inc. is one of the technology industry's biggest legal battles in years. Here are some people likely to play key roles in the trial. Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers U.S. District Judge Gonzalez Rogers, nominated by former President Obama and confirmed in 2011, has presided over the Epic-Apple case since August. The Houston native has heard cases involving Apple previously, including one that went to the Supreme Court over the company's requirement that all phone software be downloaded through the App Store and whether that resulted in higher prices for consumers. She ruled in Apple's favor that iPhone owners couldn't sue the company on antitrust grounds because they weren't direct purchasers from Apple, a decision reversed on appeal. Tim Cook Mr. Cook, Apple's chief executive since 2011, is expected to testify about its corporate values and operations, the launch of the App Store and the competition that Apple faces. He has defended the company's App Store practices, saying in a congressional hearing last year that they help create a reliable and secure user experience. Tim Sweeney The co-founder and CEO of Epic has been a critic of Apple's business practices, saying the tech giant's fees result in higher costs to developers and unfairly restrict competition by not allowing competing app stores on iOS devices. Mr. Sweeney helped mastermind a plan called ""Project Liberty"" that drew Apple into a fight in Epic's bid to challenge Apple's rules. Karen Dunn One of Apple's lawyers is Ms. Dunn, a partner at Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP. Ms. Dunn represented Apple in its lawsuit against Qualcomm Inc. over patent-licensing fees and Uber Technologies Inc. in its legal battle against Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo. Richard Doren Mr. Doren, a partner in Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, is also on Apple's legal team. He made appearances in court on Apple's behalf last year in hearings on pretrial motions. Katherine Forrest Epic is working with Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP on the lawsuit and Ms. Forrest, one of the firm's attorneys, is expected to help the game company argue its case. Ms. Forrest is a former New York federal judge and Justice Department antitrust attorney. Gary Bornstein Also part of Epic's legal team is Mr. Bornstein, co-head of Cravath's litigation department, with a focus on antitrust, merger and acquisition and securities litigation. Phil Schiller The longtime Apple executive and friend of the late Steve Jobs helped remake the company from a struggling computer maker into the world's biggest by market value, playing a key role in the launches of the iPod, iPhone and iPad as well as in Apple advertising. Mr. Schiller, whose current title is Apple Fellow, is expected to testify about Apple's business, the App Store's business model, the iOS operating system and iPhone development and launch. Lori Wright Ms. Wright, vice president of Xbox business development at Microsoft Corp., is one of the third-party witnesses expected to testify during the call. Epic and Apple have called her to testify about software distribution, Xbox cloud gaming and her company's interactions with Apple. Microsoft is among companies that has significant dealings with both Epic and Apple because it is a game publisher, hardware developer and operates a game software-distribution platform. Craig Federighi Apple's senior vice president of software engineering oversees the development of iOS and macOS. Mr. Federighi, a longtime Apple executive, is expected to be called to testify by Apple and Epic about iOS and issues related to app security. Scott Forstall Epic and Apple plan to call Mr. Forstall, the former head of Apple's mobile-software unit, to testify about operating systems for mobile devices and personal computers, historical App Store policies and Apple's in-app purchasing function. He left Apple nearly a decade ago in one of Mr. Cook's earliest management shake-ups as CEO. According to a deposition cited in court filings, Mr. Forstall was among people who helped persuade Mr. Jobs to enable third-party native app development on the iPhone. Ned Barnes Epic is slated to present testimony from Mr. Barnes, a forensic accountant who is a managing director at consulting firm Berkeley Research Group. Just days before the trial, Apple filed a motion to close the courtroom for the entirety of Mr. Barnes's testimony amid concern that his analysis of App Store financials could ""confuse the securities markets."" The court denied a blanket seal and enabled parts of his written testimony to be sealed."
Apple,Technology,1 December 2022,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,053 words",-0.5273,0.06,0.062,0.878,"A potential battle between Apple Inc. and Twitter Inc. appears to have been averted after a meeting between Elon Musk and Tim Cook. Mr. Musk, the new owner of Twitter, said in a set of tweets Wednesday that he had met with the Apple chief executive. ""Good conversation,"" Mr. Musk wrote . ""Among other things, we resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store. Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so."" The suggestion of a detente was first raised when Mr. Musk tweeted a video that appeared to be taken in the parklike setting on the grounds of the Apple headquarters. The missive came just two days after the new Twitter boss launched attacks on the iPhone maker's App Store and advertising. ""Thanks @tim_cook for taking me around Apple's beautiful HQ,"" Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter. Mr. Musk on Monday accused Apple of stanching free speech and claimed the tech giant had threatened to kick the Twitter app off the iPhone. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment. A meeting between Mr. Musk, the world's richest man, and Mr. Cook, head of its most valuable company, was an unexpected outcome with the two appearing to be on a collision course following Monday's broadside by Mr. Musk. Still, both Twitter and Apple have many reasons to keep the peace. Apple is one of Twitter's biggest advertisers and controls access to its iPhone and its more than one billion users. Mr. Musk has said Apple threatened to take Twitter's app off the App Store, the digital marketplace where iPhone users download third-party software. Meanwhile, Mr. Musk's push back against Apple threatens to pull the iPhone maker further into the crosshairs of Republican lawmakers nervous about the power Silicon Valley holds. Mr. Musk has framed his fight with Apple as one against Big Tech squashing freedom of speech. Before Mr. Musk's acquisition of Twitter about a month ago, he and Mr. Cook seemingly had little overlap in their business lives. In 2021, Mr. Cook said he had never spoken with Mr. Musk, though the two men had shared time around a table with Donald Trump shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Musk, whose fortune is tied up mostly in Tesla Inc. and rocket company SpaceX, has said he once reached out to Mr. Cook for help when the electric car maker was struggling to increase production of the Model 3 compact car and its finances were strained. Mr. Cook never took that meeting. Wednesday's visit apparently included a stop at the pond on Apple's campus in Cupertino, Calif., according to video shared by Mr. Musk. The serene imagery is at striking contrast to the whirlwind surrounding Mr. Musk since taking ownership of Twitter. Since his takeover, some advertisers have restrained spending amid concerns about his ability to rein in objectionable content on the platform and the rapid pace of change at the company. Mr. Musk has said the company is losing $4 million a day and warned employees that bankruptcy isn't out of the question. He is racing to remake Twitter's business. That has included slashing costs, including laying off about half of the company, and efforts to boost nonad revenue through a beefier subscription service that promises to deliver Twitter's famed blue check mark to users for a price. The check marks had once been given away free to high-profile users as a way of verifying identity but have become seen by some as classist. The rollout of the new service has been hit with snags. A fight with Apple could further threaten its distribution through the App Store. Traditionally, Apple warns app developers about concerns it may have or requests for changes and software makers are given a couple of weeks to address issues. If they choose not to make the fixes or resist, Apple has declined to allow apps to be updated through the App Store. In rare cases, it has deleted apps from its App store. About 64% of Twitter users in the U.S. use Apple's mobile operating system for iPhone or iPad compared with 36% using Alphabet Inc.'s Android, according to Sensor Tower data. Apple would stand to get a piece of any additional subscription revenue generated at Twitter as part of its App Store. Mr. Musk has publicly criticized the fee, which can run as high as 30%. The fee has been at the heart of some app developers' complaints for years. ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games Inc. has fought Apple for more than two years in court over the matter, claiming Apple holds an improper monopoly over distribution of apps onto the iPhone and forcing apps to use its in-app payment system. Apple, which has said its fees are in line with industry norms and fair for what it offers developers, mostly won the court battle last year but still faces Epic in the appeals process. Mr. Musk's comments set off criticism of Apple from several high-profile conservative politicians. Apple already had been under scrutiny in Washington earlier this year over the power of its App Store and has lobbied against legislation that would rein in how it controls third-party software distributed to its iPhones. On the Hugh Hewitt Show, Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.), called a potential move by Apple to deplatform Twitter ""ill-advised"" and suggested Mr. Cook was envious of Mr. Musk's business success. An Apple decision to ban Twitter from its App Store ""would be a huge, huge mistake, and it would be a really raw exercise of monopolistic power,"" Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday at a news conference. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.), who is among the sponsors of legislation that would rein in Apple's App Store, said in a tweet that her bill would ""dissolve"" Apple and Google's power over third-party software.

Apple,Technology,1 November 2019,The Wall Street Journal,"1,143 words",0.9614,0.091,0.069,0.84,"Apple Inc. became a colossus by redefining gadgets including the smartphone, the tablet and the smartwatch. As it takes aim at Hollywood, it is working from a very different script. On Friday, the company plans to launch the Apple TV+ video service, its contender in the battle between media and tech giants for people's streaming dollars. Apple TV+ is slated to start with nine programs, including a buzzy drama about television news called ""The Morning Show"" featuring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell. Other offerings include ""See,"" set in a future when humans lack sight, and ""Snoopy in Space,"" for children. Apple's enormous size, $100-billion cash hoard and fat profit margins mean it can afford the costs of developing and distributing new content. And the more than 900 million iPhones and 500 million other Apple gadgets in use world-wide give it an enormous, built-in base of potential TV+ customers. But entertainment takes Apple well outside its wheelhouse, and much about its approach to the streaming wars departs from its usual strategy. Apple is used to charging far more for its iPhones, iPads and Macs than rivals do for their products. It controls its own ecosystem of hardware and software products and carefully rolls out new versions of its gadgets once a year at most. With TV+, Apple is charging less than competitors and pushing its service aggressively on other platforms. A company accustomed to hits is entering a world where TV shows and movies fail with regularity. And the secretive Silicon Valley titan is contending with critical scrutiny in Hollywood that far exceeds the business's importance to Apple's bottom line. Critical reviews of the offerings on Apple TV+ have been mixed. Time said ""The Morning Show"" lacks the depth and spirit of top TV shows, while New York Media's Vulture called it a ""glossy, largely compelling new series."" Hollywood-focused Variety's critics found fault with other Apple shows, saying none was ""stellar enough to justify someone buying in to a whole new streaming service."" An Apple spokesman declined to comment. ""Honestly the world should give Apple a little leeway,"" said ""See"" executive producer Francis Lawrence. ""Nobody can be perfect 100% of the time."" Hollywood is central to Chief Executive Tim Cook's effort to refashion Apple as a services company as sales have slowed for its original products. Sales of its bread-and-butter iPhone fell 14% for the fiscal year ended in September, dragging the company's total revenue down 2% to $260.17 billion. The hardware heavyweight, though, has a threadbare entertainment library. So its service will cost $4.99 monthly for subscribers and will be free for a year with the purchase of a new iPhone, iPad or Mac. Netflix Inc., which charges $12.99 a month for its most popular service, pioneered the category and offers more than 1,500 shows and 4,000 movies. Walt Disney Co. will charge $6.99 for Disney+, which launches 11 days after Apple's offering, with popular franchises such as ""Star Wars."" And WarnerMedia, a unit of AT&T Inc., said Tuesday it will charge $14.99 a month for HBO Max, set to launch next year with classics such as ""Friends"" and original fare. Apple struck deals to make its Apple TV app available on Roku, Amazon Fire TV devices and smart TVs from Samsung Electronics Co. Mr. Cook called the offering a bold move during a Wednesday call with analysts. He said the price is aggressive because Apple wants as many people as possible to view the shows. ""This allows us to focus on maximizing subscribers,"" he said. Apple is also rolling out its programming in a way that straddles Netflix's all-at-once strategy with the one-episode-a-week style of HBO and others. Initially, it will offer three episodes of some shows, such as ""For All Mankind,"" about the U.S. space program in a world where Russia landed first on the moon, and add a new episode each subsequent week. Others such as ""Dickinson,"" about a young Emily Dickinson, will be available in their totality. Apple is famously fastidious about its brand. So far, its slate of shows features themes of resilience and aspiration. The focus -- combined with an aversion to over-the-top gratuitous sex, violence and language -- has led some Hollywood creators to question if Apple TV+ will be as risque as Netflix, FX or HBO, whose programs often embrace the underbelly of culture and society. To be sure, in entertainment the definition of a brand is often fluid, especially if the shows designed to fit that brand fail to catch on and a show that doesn't becomes a success. ""You're not allowed to go into this without pretending you have a brand, but then your brand becomes whatever your hit show is,"" said producer Mike Royce, whose credits include ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" and the reboot of ""One Day at a Time."" If Apple can amass 50 million subscribers for TV+, about as many as it has for its music-streaming service, it would add $3 billion in annual sales, estimates Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research. That steady subscription revenue would help reduce iPhone dependency -- though it is tiny compared with Apple's $250 billion in total annual sales. Apple also wants to draw viewers to its TV app and encourage them to subscribe to other services, such as Starz and Showtime, that can be accessed through the app, according to people familiar with the strategy. It gets a 30% cut of other subscriptions initially. The business strategy is being fashioned by Peter Stern, who joined Apple in 2016 after overseeing strategy at Time Warner Cable Inc. Last year, the Yale Law School graduate was promoted to oversee Apple's video, news, books, iCloud and ad-services businesses. He has looked for ways to bundle services and directly market subscriptions, people familiar with the strategy said. The company unveiled one offer Wednesday, with actor Hailee Steinfeld, who stars in ""Dickinson,"" announcing on Instagram that TV+ will be free to college students who subscribe to Apple Music. Apple's decision to bundle TV+ with sales of its gadgets will hurt its hardware business for financial reporting purposes but help services, because it reduces a $699 iPhone sale by $60 -- the annual cost to subscribe to TV+ -- which will be recognized as services revenue, analysts say. In the future, though, TV+ can serve as a marketing tool that deepens the appeal of new iPhones with incremental features, Mr. Sacconaghi said. ""They now have something they can use to help maybe iPhone or other product demand,"" he said."
Apple,Business,5 August 2021,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,150 words",-0.9945,0.061,0.113,0.826,"Apple Inc. plans to introduce new iPhone software designed to identify and report collections of sexually exploitative images of children, aiming to bridge the yearslong divide between the company's pledge to protect customer privacy and law enforcement's desire to learn of illegal activity happening on the device. The software, slated for release in an update for U.S. users later this year, is part of a series of changes Apple is preparing for the iPhone to protect children from sexual predators, the company said Thursday. Apple, which has built much of its brand image in recent years on promises to safeguard users' privacy, says that its new software will further enhance those protections by avoiding any need for widespread scanning of images on the company's servers, something that Apple currently doesn't perform. After news of Apple's plans leaked out Wednesday, critics said they worried that by building software that can flag illegal content belonging to its users, Apple may be softening its stance on how it protects user data via encryption— a source of growing contention between the technology giant and law-enforcement organizations over the past decade. Apple's system will use new techniques in cryptography and artificial intelligence to identify child sexual abuse material when it is stored using iCloud Photos, the company said. Using software that runs on both the iPhone and Apple's cloud, Apple will detect whether images on the device match a known database of these illegal images. If a certain number of them—Apple declined to say exactly how many—are uploaded to iCloud Photos, Apple will review the images. If they are found to be illegal, Apple says it will report them to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a private, nonprofit organization established in 1984 under a congressional mandate that serves as a clearinghouse for reports of child abuse. The software will detect illegal images, but doesn't work on videos, Apple says. The system aims to provide a counter to law enforcement's criticism that Apple doesn't do enough to help identify criminals who hide their illegal activity behind encryption. Apple has made the security it offers users on its iPhones and some other devices a key element of its pitch to consumers, adding ever more features to safeguard their privacy. The privacy stance, at times, has led the company to clash with governments. In the wake of the December 2019 attack by a Saudi aviation student that killed three people at a Florida Navy base , then-Attorney General William Barr called on Apple to find a way to crack the encrypted phones. The Justice Department also attempted in 2016 under the Obama administration to push Apple to create a software update that would break the privacy protections of the iPhone to gain access to a phone linked to a dead gunman responsible for a 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. The company has refused to build tools that break the iPhone's encryption, saying that such software would undermine user privacy. The issue around sexual images of children stored on Apple iPhones dates back to the early days of the device when, back in 2008, one was found with such imagery. A judge ordered Apple to assist the government in unlocking the iPhone . The company complied, though it has since significantly upgraded security features on the device that have made accessing data stored there more challenging. Law-enforcement authorities frequently point to child pornography and the use of encrypted communications by terrorists to argue for data access. ""Apple's expanded protection for children is a game changer,"" John Clark, president and CEO of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said in a statement Thursday. ""The reality is that privacy and child protection can coexist."" The planned software update to detect child sexual abuse material wouldn't affect the iPhone's encryption system and it allows iPhone users to keep their data on the device completely private, Apple says. Users who don't upload their images to iCloud Photos wouldn't trigger the detection system, Apple said. As part of the enhancements, Apple will also add features that will give the iPhone a way of blurring out and then warning children if they are sending or receiving sexually explicit photos via the company's Messages app. The software can be configured to alert parents, too. Because Messages is the app used to send encrypted iMessages, Apple's new alerting functionality could be of interest to governments looking to push Apple into conducting surveillance of its phones, said Matthew Green, an associate professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University. ""Now Apple has demonstrated that they can build a surveillance system, for very specific purposes, that works with iMessage,"" he said. ""I wonder how long they'll be able to hold out from the Chinese government?"" Apple says that its software isn't designed for mass surveillance or the scanning of content on its devices. It is an argument that isn't sitting well with privacy proponents. ""Apple can explain at length how its technical implementation will preserve privacy and security in its proposed backdoor, but at the end of the day, even a thoroughly documented, carefully thought-out, and narrowly-scoped backdoor is still a backdoor,"" the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights watchdog group, said Thursday. The iPhone no longer represents the impenetrable data safe it once did as companies including Grayshift LLC, Israel's Cellebrite Mobile Synchronization Ltd. and others have developed methods to retrieve data from the devices. Spyware from NSO Group, an Israeli company, also has been found on iPhones . The iPhone maker isn't the only tech company to spar with governments over the issue of encryption. Facebook Inc. has rolled out encryption more widely across its platform, also drawing fire from law-enforcement authorities in the U.S. and abroad, who argued, in part, it would make it more difficult to pursue child-exploitation cases . ""Companies cannot operate with impunity where lives and the safety of our children is at stake,"" Mr. Barr said in an open letter criticizing Facebook's encrypted messaging systems in 2019 . A Facebook spokesman was unable to immediately comment on whether the company would follow Apple's move. Apple's privacy push hasn't just led to battles with law enforcement. This year the company rolled out a new operating system that makes ad-tracking harder. The move created a clash with Facebook and others and has driven advertisers to shift how they market to consumers . Apple Plans to Have iPhones Detect Child Pornography, Fueling Privacy Debate (""https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-to-have-iphones-detect-child-pornography-fueling-privacy-debate-11628190971"")"
Apple,Technology,17 March 2022,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,150 words",0.9518,0.068,0.042,0.891,"Apple Inc . is facing one of the biggest challenges yet to how it controls and profits from the App Store as Europe prepares to complete a new competition law in the coming weeks. The new European Union legislation —which could be effectively completed as soon as this month—is set to direct Apple to allow software to be downloaded outside its cash-generating App Store and limit how companies impose their own payment systems on apps, according to people involved in the negotiations. Failure to comply would carry penalties of up to tens of billions of dollars. For the past two years, the iPhone maker has battled lawmakers, regulators and rivals around the world to defend how it serves as the gate keeper to more than one billion users of its devices. Critics accuse Apple of hurting competition by forcing app developers to use its store and payment tools , from which it extracts a commission of up to 30% for in-app purchases. Apple has countered that it is giving consumers a choice of a digital platform that has proven popular with customers and that proposed changes would open users up to threats to security and privacy, and weaken the overall iPhone experience. Rivals and critics of Apple 's power hope the EU law will serve as a catalyst for other jurisdictions, such as in the U.S., where similar legislation is pending before Congress. ""Apple is playing 5D chess right now,"" said Paul Gallant, a policy analyst for Cowen & Co . ""It will struggle to explain why government changes will radically change the iPhone when Google already does it and it will struggle to explain why it can't do it in the United States when it may soon do it in Europe."" As the language is finalized behind closed doors, most tech companies and their lobbyists are resigned to passage of the so-called Digital Markets Act. Other provisions in the DMA are aimed at the likes of Amazon.com Inc . and Google parent Alphabet Inc . The DMA's most existential threat to Apple comes with a provision that would allow software makers access to the iPhone—through so-called sideloading—outside of the rules and payment scheme of Apple 's App Store. One recent draft of the DMA, overwhelmingly approved in December by a 642-8 European Parliament vote, included sideloading. Apple said in a statement that the DMA will undermine its security and allow malicious actors to take advantage of sideloading. ""Governments and international agencies world-wide have explicitly advised against sideloading requirements, which would cripple the privacy and security protections that users have come to expect,"" Apple said in the statement. The full effect of the sideloading provision isn't yet clear as lawmakers work on final language defining security exceptions that could give Apple leeway to limit the scope of sideloading. After the text is agreed upon by negotiators for the parliament and member states as early as this month, the bill is expected to be officially approved by both bodies in coming months. Based on that timeline, it would take effect early next year. Apple has pushed back when ordered to loosen its grip over the app economy, such as by a U.S. federal judge, legislators in South Korea and antitrust enforcers in the Netherlands. Apple has responded to those orders with appeals or narrow policy changes, refraining from bigger changes that could reduce the billions it takes in from app store commissions. The EU 's antitrust chief, a major proponent of the DMA, has pointed to Apple 's recent moves and cautioned that the bloc must give itself enforcement power in the law to make its provisions stick. ""Apple essentially prefers paying periodic fines, rather than comply with a decision of the Dutch Competition Authority ,"" said Margrethe Vestager , the top digital policy and competition official at the EU 's executive arm, in a speech last month. ""Effective enforcement, which includes the Commission having sufficient resources to do so, will be key to ensure compliance,"" she said. In early drafts, failure to comply with the DMA would be punishable by fines of up to 10% of a company's annual global revenue, which for Apple currently would equate to $37 billion, but some legislators have pushed for a higher ceiling. Court filings have suggested around 20% of Apple 's annual operating income comes from App Store revenue . Apple has said that estimate is too high, but hasn't disclosed an alternative amount. That figure underscores why some of the App Store's biggest revenue generators have been aggressively pushing for changes. Spotify Technology SA and Match Group Inc . have been successful in lobbying to include language in the act that would oblige Apple to allow developers to use competing in-app payment systems, according to people familiar with the matter. ""It is much easier for let's say companies like Spotify or the Match Group to make their case because it is a clear-cut case,"" said Andreas Schwab, a German member of European Parliament who is in charge of shepherding the bill. ""The gate keepers have more difficulties explaining their business practices so clearly,"" he added. If the DMA passes as expected, Apple could attempt to challenge the enforcement of the law, both through litigation and in the minutiae of App Store policy changes it puts in place to comply, according to analysts and people involved in the negotiations. The biggest changes to Apple 's App Store were ordered in September by a federal judge in California who oversaw an antitrust lawsuit by ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games Inc . While Apple mostly won the case, the judge ordered Apple to stop prohibiting app developers from being able to send users inside their apps to cheaper alternative payment methods outside of the app. But that change is on hold while Apple appeals the ruling. When an antitrust regulator in the Netherlands ordered Apple to allow alternative payments in dating apps in that country, Apple responded while still charging apps a fee, 27% of revenue instead of 30%. The changes haven't satisfied the Dutch, who are fining Apple more than $5 million a week.

Apple,"Apple, Goldman Sachs Team Up on Credit Card",11 May 2018,The Wall Street Journal,831 words,0.9961,0.112,0.042,0.846,"Apple Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are preparing to launch a new joint credit card, a move that would deepen the technology giant's push into its customers' wallets and mark the Wall Street firm's first foray into plastic. The planned card would carry the Apple Pay brand and could launch early next year, people familiar with the matter said. Apple will replace its longstanding rewards-card partnership with Barclays PLC, the people said. The Apple-Goldman card could help the companies combat weaknesses in their core businesses. As new iPhone sales growth slows, Apple is focusing on services such as mobile payments, streaming-music subscriptions and App Store sales. Apple Pay, which generates revenue on each transaction, is a key contributor, but adoption has been slower than executives hoped. Goldman, meanwhile, is pushing into consumer banking to compensate for a slump in securities trading, where revenue has fallen by two-thirds since the financial crisis. It launched a retail banking business called Marcus in 2016 for online savings accounts and personal loans, and executives have been exploring adding credit cards and wealth-management tools. The partnership will extend into other services including Goldman offering in-store loans to Apple customers buying iPhones and other gadgets, an effort The Wall Street Journal reported on in February. Apple and Goldman are still hashing out the terms and benefits of the planned card including the perks for customers, these people said. The current Apple credit card with Barclays offers interest-free financing on Apple devices and points toward Apple gift cards. Apple, Goldman and Barclays declined to comment. The Apple Pay card is the latest example of a technology giant broadening its presence in the banking and finance industry. Besides Apple, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Samsung Electronics Co. are all vying to make mobile payments easier for consumers while adding to their formidable revenue streams. Goldman has the potential to raise Apple Pay's profile, tying the mobile payment service to plastic touted in advertising and pushed by cashiers at Apple stores. Apple also stands to boost its revenue by collecting a bounty from Goldman for each new cardholder, the people said. These payments, which are common in store-brand cards, can exceed $100 per account. With the Barclays card, Apple declined to collect bounties and instead put that money toward interest-free financing of devices. Additionally, Apple could take a larger cut of mobile payments from the card if it is used for purchases, the person said. Currently, when a consumer pays for a purchase using the digital wallet on the iPhone -- regardless of what credit card the customer charges -- Apple receives 0.15% per transaction. Apple could more than double that under the agreement with Goldman, one of the people said. The additional revenue could help Apple as it pursues a goal of doubling its services business to about $50 billion annually by 2020 from $24.35 billion in 2016. But as Apple shifts from a Barclays card that encourages device sales with interest-free financing to a card designed to boost Apple Pay, the challenge could be driving enough of an uptick in mobile payments to offset any decline of high-price iPhones, iPads or Macs. For Goldman, the card could help its nascent retail-banking operation, launched in 2016, add new customers who may be sold other banking products. It also deepens the firm's ties to Apple, a company its bankers have advised in deals and fundraisings for years. Without branches or a well-known Main Street brand, Goldman has relied on referrals and pays for customer leads from firms including tax-preparation software maker Intuit Inc. and personal-finance website Credit Karma Inc. Last month it bought personal-finance app Clarity Money, gaining access to its roughly one million users. Still, the push into credit cards is fraught for Goldman, whose track record in consumer finance is scarcely two-years old. Credit cards are a cutthroat business dominated by larger rivals like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. Yields are falling. And Goldman lacks much of the infrastructure to be able to issue credit cards and process payments to merchants. After marketing its Marcus products in part by criticizing credit-card fees and high interest rates, its entry into that business may invite criticism from consumer advocates and regulators. It is unclear which card network -- Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. or Discover Financial Services -- will process transactions for the new card. Apple has had a longstanding relationship with Visa, which is based in San Francisco. Barclaycard executives managing the Apple account met at the tech giant's Cupertino, Calif., office in recent weeks to determine whether the account -- one of its most high profile -- would be extended, a person familiar with the meeting said. The bank began issuing the Apple credit card in 2005. --- AnnaMaria Andriotis contributed to this article."
Apple,Lateness Bedevils Apple CEO Cook,6 January 2018,The Wall Street Journal,892 words,0.9859,0.087,0.048,0.865,"As Apple Inc.'s longtime chief operating officer, Tim Cook was known for ensuring that new products hit the market on schedule. With Mr. Cook as CEO, though, Apple's new gadgets are consistently late, prompting questions among analysts and other close observers about whether the technology giant is losing some of its competitive edge. Of the three major new products since Mr. Cook became chief executive in 2011, both AirPods earbuds in 2016 and last year's HomePod speaker missed Apple's publicly projected shipping dates. The Apple Watch, promised for early 2015, arrived late that April with lengthy wait times for delivery. Apple also was delayed in supplying the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard, two critical accessories for its iPad Pro. Mr. Cook's tenure has been successful by other measures: Revenue has more than doubled, despite stalling in the past two years, and Apple's share price has more than tripled in the past six years to record-high territory. The company has said it expects in the final three months of 2017 to hit a new sales record. But the delays have contributed to much longer waits between Apple announcing a product and shipping it: an average of 23 days for new and updated products over the past six years, compared with the 11-day average over the six years prior, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Apple public statements. Longer lead times between announcement and product release have the potential to hurt Apple on multiple fronts. Delays give rivals time to react, something the company tried to prevent in the past by keeping lead times short, analysts and former Apple employees said. They also have cost Apple sales and can stoke customer disappointment. Production issues contributed to the company largely missing the important Christmas shopping season with its two newest products, AirPods and HomePods. When the $349 HomePod was unveiled in June, Apple touted its superior sound and said it would be ready in December. Then Apple said in November that shipment would be delayed until this year, causing it to lose out on a gift-giving season when such smart speakers were big sellers. Apple hasn't yet given a new arrival estimate. Meanwhile, Amazon.com Inc. in September announced a redesigned Echo for $99 with sound-boosting processing from Dolby Laboratories, Inc. Weeks later, Alphabet Inc.'s Google unveiled an improved speaker of its own, the Google Home Max, for $399. The HomePod delay was ""a huge opening"" for Amazon and Google to increase sales to loyal iPhone and iPad customers, said Matt Sargent, an executive at research-based consultancy Magid. Apple seems ""to be losing step, and that's a big strategic concern with how they're positioning the brand,"" he said. Apple declined to make Mr. Cook available. Apple seldom explains why products are delayed and in the case of the HomePod said only that it wasn't ready. One reason for the delays could lie in the differences in approach between Mr. Cook and his predecessor Steve Jobs. Mr. Cook announces products and shipment dates earlier than did Mr. Jobs, who former employees said preferred waiting until products were ready for shipment before publicizing them, except for unique devices like the iPhone and Apple TV. For instance, Apple shipped its flagship handset, the iPhone X, in November, six weeks later than it usually does with new models following production bottlenecks over the summer. Mr. Cook said during a November interview with The Wall Street Journal that Apple would have preferred to ship the iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus simultaneously in September when the devices were introduced, but ""didn't have that choice"" because the iPhone X, which was slated to ship later, wasn't ready. Still, he went with announcing all three devices at the same time so that customers could choose the phone they most wanted. The staggered schedule led many customers to hold off iPhone purchases in September and October, triggering a 7.6-percentage point decline in U.S. market share for smartphones in the October quarter to 32.9%, according to Kantar Worldpanel. Mr. Cook acknowledged in the interview the release schedule may have affected sales but was best for customers. Neil Cybart, who runs Above Avalon, a site dedicated to analysis of Apple, said he has grown concerned that the delays could indicate Apple is struggling with limited time and attention of talented engineers and executives working across so many products. Updated models of its biggest products -- iPhones, iPads and Macs -- largely have arrived on schedule. But in recent years, Apple has added new products at a much faster clip than under Mr. Jobs. Under Mr. Cook, who oversaw manufacturing and operations before becoming CEO, Apple's product portfolio has more than doubled since 2007. Apple's large and global customer base also add to logistical and manufacturing challenges, former employees said. The company now has an estimated 1.1 billion devices in use world-wide, about triple the 400 million in early 2013, according to market-research outfit Asymco. ""It's not the little Ferrari that Steve built for himself,"" said Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates. ""It's become this big organization, and that has to contribute to some unevenness of execution."""
Apple,Technology,11 September 2019,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,366 words",0.9927,0.092,0.039,0.869,"CUPERTINO, Calif.—Apple Inc. revealed a trio of upgraded iPhones, including a lower-priced model, and detailed its plans to enter the increasingly competitive video-streaming market with an offering that is cheaper than rivals. The announcements came Tuesday at Apple's marquee product showcase, where this year the tech giant sought to balance its penchant for premium products with an emphasis on value. Apple is looking to offset slowing hardware sales by selling newer services, such as TV streaming, videogames and news—and it is being aggressive on pricing to gain a foothold in those cutthroat industries. Apple set monthly prices for its TV+ video-streaming service and Arcade videogame-streaming service at $4.99, largely undercutting rivals. TV+ comes free for a year with the purchase of a new iPhone, iPad or Mac, a perk that could get more people to buy a new device or upgrade. Apple can afford to discount the services because of the profits it earns on hardware and its distribution edge over competitors, with more than 1.4 billion devices in use world-wide. The company is making just a handful of shows available for the TV+ debut in November, so the service will be a tough sell against the deeper programming catalogs offered by streaming rivals Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. But at $4.99 a month, TV+ is much cheaper than Netflix's $12.99 monthly standard option and Disney's $6.99 monthly fee for a service expected to arrive in November. ""Clearly, they want their customers to use it and not feel forced to choose between it and Netflix or Hulu,"" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies. She added that Apple could offer lower prices on services without affecting its historical brand position in hardware as a luxury-device maker. Related * Live Coverage of Apple iPhone 2019 Event * Apple's Revenue Rises Despite Continued iPhone Slump (July 30) * Jony Ive Is Leaving Apple, but His Departure Started Long Ago (June 30) Netflix doesn't see the low prices as a threat, because they make it more likely Netflix customers won't be forced into a choice if they want to add another streaming service, an executive familiar with the company's strategy said. At Tuesday's event—held in the Steve Jobs Theater, the on-campus auditorium named after Apple's co-founder—Apple lavished much of its time on the flagship device that Mr. Jobs helped create a dozen years ago. The new but familiar-looking iPhones, now under the iPhone 11 brand, blended standard updates such as longer-lasting batteries and new colors with more innovative features such as a night mode for low-light photos and the ability to shoot video by holding down the camera button. Apple lowered the price of its most popular model by $50, countering three consecutive years of price increases. The iPhone 11, a 6.1-inch device that updates last year's XR model, will start at $699 and include a dual-rear camera. The iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, with triple-rear cameras, play to the premium market with prices of $999 and $1,099. Apple also introduced an updated smartwatch with improved power that allows it to display time throughout the day, and cut the price of an earlier model to its lowest point yet. The company didn't reveal any surprise new devices, delivering instead the type of incremental hardware improvements that have defined its events in recent years and stirred up questions about Apple's innovation prowess under Chief Executive Tim Cook. Mr. Jobs's successor has transformed Apple into one of the world's most profitable companies but hasn't delivered a megahit product on par with the iPhone, which arrived in 2007, or the iPad, first released in 2010, the year before Mr. Cook took over. The Apple Watch made its debut five years ago and has largely been a success, as have the more recent AirPods wireless earbuds, but not enough to shore up falling iPhone sales. Mr. Cook has since pushed Apple to leverage its hardware success to sell more software and services. TV+ will make its debut Nov. 1 with shows such as ""The Morning Show,"" a drama about a morning talk show starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. Other shows will be added in the months afterward, Mr. Cook said. The watch and new subscription services are central to Apple's efforts to diversify its business as the iPhone falters. Its customers are holding on to current iPhones longer and bristling at prices of new models that average nearly $1,000. Those struggles are particularly acute in China, where Apple is battling increased competition, trade tensions and a decelerating economy. Apple also made the Apple Watch a better value, reducing the price of the Series 3 model about 30% to $199 and maintaining a price of $399 on its newest model, the Series 5. The smartwatch prices showed Apple is willing to eat the cost of tariffs rather than pass them on to consumers. The Apple Watch was among its first products subjected to the 15% tariffs the Trump administration introduced on $111 billion in Chinese-made goods this month. Apple can absorb the extra costs of tariffs without it affecting margins because memory prices have fallen in recent years, providing a cushion, analysts said. To sustain growth, Apple must squeeze more money out of existing customers by leveraging past hardware success to sell newer products and services. It has over 900 million iPhone users world-wide, but only a fraction own an Apple Watch or pay for the company's streaming-music service. It has rolled out several new accessories and services to deepen its reach into users' wallets, including its AirPods, a credit card and a videogame service called Arcade. The emphasis on services and newer products has coincided with several high-profile executive departures, including design chief Jony Ive, who will leave this year to start his own design firm. It has also revived questions about the company's ability to offer the type of hardware innovations that turned the iPhone into one of the world's best-selling products. ""Apple isn't growing like they were before,"" said Mike Frazier, president of Bedell Frazier Investment Counselling, a Walnut Creek, Calif.-based firm with about $500 million under management that counted Apple as its largest holding before scaling back its investment this year. ""They're a victim of their own success."" Apple needs to encourage enough iPhone upgrades to avoid repeating the smartphone sales slump that dogged the company last year, forcing it to slash its revenue forecast in January for the first time in more than 15 years. World-wide sales of the company's smartphones fell 15% to $109.02 billion for the three quarters ended in June . Shipments have declined an estimated 17% over that period, according to analysts, outpacing the smartphone industry's projected decline of 2% this year. Share Your Thoughts Do you plan on switching to any of the new iPhone models? Why or why not? Join the conversation below. Wall Street has already begun to look ahead to next year's models that are expected to feature 5G, a faster fifth generation of wireless technology that will result in speedier smartphones. Apple will be lagging behind rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. in bringing that technology to market. ""They will lose market share in China in the premium space without 5G because the country is going to ensure 5G is relevant,"" said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. ""That will trigger adoption of Huawei, Xiaomi and others and hurt Apple."" Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.

Apple,WSJ Pro,21 October 2020,WSJ Pro Cybersecurity,"1,008 words",0.9714,0.082,0.055,0.863,"English , Inc. Months after a burst of optimism about the potential for technology to help track the spread of Covid-19, a hodgepodge of mobile phone apps around the U.S. has yielded unclear results amid inconsistent policies and usage. Ten states and Washington, D.C., have launched apps that notify users of exposure to infected people through a development framework built by Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Apple Inc. Eleven more are either piloting or building such tools. But the lack of a national strategy—unlike in many European countries that have adopted such apps—adds a hurdle to making sure the tools work across state lines as case counts tick upward, tech and public health experts say. ""If you're going to have a lot of jurisdictional boundaries that cut through this, it will naturally make the system less effective,"" said Eric Rescorla, chief technology officer of Mozilla Corp.'s Firefox web browser. Advances in the Bluetooth-based Google-Apple system in recent months have reduced the cost for states to opt in, and created a central server to store anonymized markers of positive tests for when phones cross state lines. Some state governments also are collaborating to roll out tools they see as a useful addition to a disease-fighting tool kit that includes mask wearing, social distancing and traditional contact tracing through phone calls and other manual outreach. California, Oregon and Washington last month announced pilot programs for apps on the Google-Apple system. Pennsylvania and Delaware last month launched apps created by Irish developer NearForm Ltd., which has built tools for several European countries. New York and New Jersey unveiled NearForm-made apps this month. ""You have a lot of cross-border travel,"" said Larry Schwartz, who led New York's app push on the state's Covid-19 task force. ""We have people from New Jersey who work in New York, and vice versa."" About 1.2 million people have downloaded the NearForm apps across New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, according to the company and state officials. In Delaware, about 10% of people who test positive in the state report that they have downloaded its app, said Molly Magarik, Department of Health and Social Services secretary. More than 80% of those users say they accepted a six-digit code that verified their test result and allowed their phone to send notifications to other devices, she said. Still, some public health experts remain skeptical that the apps will push users to isolate or get tested. ""What evidence do we have that these make a difference?"" said James Thomas, a professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""Is it a placebo for us to feel better about what we're doing—and feel like we have a high-tech response—or does it make a dent in the number of cases we're seeing?"" In some cases, the lack of evidence is by design, said Joanna Masel, a University of Arizona biology professor who is helping to lead the state's app pilot program at her school and Northern Arizona University. About 33,000 people have downloaded the app around the university campuses, Ms. Masel said, and those who tested positive for Covid-19 increasingly are entering verification codes on the app. But she declined to provide specific numbers for the latter metric. ""The reason we're not sharing information is we're really concerned people will think it's not private,"" she said. While some public health experts prefer Global Positioning System data to aid traditional contact tracing, which tracks people's interactions and movements, privacy experts warn it could lead to surveillance. The Arizona project relies on a blueprint unveiled by Google and Apple in May using only Bluetooth-enabled alerts of users' proximity rather than collecting GPS location data. Apple last month rolled out an upgrade that allows iPhone users in participating states, like Colorado, to opt into the network without a dedicated app. The Association of Public Health Laboratories, a trade group, also has partnered with the two companies, as well as Microsoft Corp., to develop a central server that stores anonymized verification codes for infected people across the Google-Apple system. Eight states with statewide apps and two with pilot programs have opted in so far, according to the trade group's website. Still, 27 states haven't launched an app or aren't actively developing one, public health officials said. Many cited concerns about utility, in addition to real or perceived privacy fears. ""There is much distrust around contact tracing as it is,"" said Nancy Nydam, spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Public Health. Attempts to use apps stalled in at least two states after they launched GPS-based tools from local developers in the early months of the crisis. In April, South Dakota adopted the Care19 app built by a developer best known for an app that connects North Dakota State University football fans during the team's frequent national championship runs. The state hasn't moved forward with a tool on the Google-Apple system. Similarly, in Utah, the Healthy Together app disabled its location-tracking feature in July, said Jared Allgood, co-founder of Twenty Holdings Inc., the app's developer. The company, which previously built an app called Twenty marketed as a tool to help ""real friends"" meet up in ""real life,"" remains in talks with Google and Apple to jump to their system, a spokeswoman said. Healthy Together, which has more than 94,000 users in Utah, has shifted away from trying to track the virus and toward surveying symptoms and relaying test results, Mr. Allgood said. ""We were early,"" he added. ""For everybody, it was their first pandemic."" (""mailto:david.uberti@wsj.com"")"
Apple,U.S. Markets,2 November 2018,The Wall Street Journal Online,879 words,0.9957,0.149,0.082,0.77,"Corrections & Amplifications The S&P 500 posted its strongest weekly performance since March. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said it was the best since May. A big drop in shares of Apple dragged major U.S. stock indexes into the red Friday, breaking their three-session winning streak. The iPhone maker's shares lost $14.74, or 6.6%, to $207.48—their biggest one-day percentage loss since January 2014—after the company gave disappointing guidance for the holiday quarter. The declines threatened to push the company's market value below $1 trillion and also spread to other big technology stocks, which had been hammered in October. Apple's tumble was responsible for about 100 points of the 109.91-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Friday's 0.4% dip brought the index to 25270.83. Friday's slump underscores the fragility of the U.S. stock market's recent rebound. After a crushing October that shaved more than $4.5 trillion from shares of companies in the U.S., Europe and Asia, the S&P 500 had risen more than 1% each of the past three trading sessions entering Friday. It still ended the week up 2.4%, its best performance since March. The broad stock-market index shed 17.31 points, or 0.6%, to 2723.06 on Friday, led by the tech sector, which slumped 1.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite posted steeper declines, down 77.06 points, or 1%, to 7356.99. Apple's results, released after the close of trading Thursday, showed the world's most valuable company turned in another period of record revenue and profit—its fourth-consecutive quarter doing so. But investors seized on two points: Its revenue forecast didn't portend explosive growth, and the company said it would stop reporting unit-sales figures for its three most recognizable brands, the iPhone, iPad and Mac. Based on Apple's current reported share count, its valuation would fall under a trillion if its stock fell below $207.04. That could change when Apple reports a new share count in its quarterly filing with securities regulators. Apple's declines put the rest of the tech sector under pressure. Netflix and Intel fell more than 2%; Google parent Alphabet dropped more than 1%; and Facebook shares declined less than 1%. Netflix and Alphabet shares had posted double-digit declines over the past month as investors soured on many highflying growth stocks. Apple had been considered immune to some of those concerns before its earnings report. Its fall exemplifies how during this earnings season, companies are getting atypically punished for disappointing quarterly results and poor guidance. ""Even though revenue and earnings numbers may be good, a lot of those eye-popping growth numbers are already known and expected this quarter,"" said Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer of wealth and investment management for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""Companies with weaker guidance are seeing the most acute selling in their share prices."" Even after weeks of battering, Mr. Cronk said he wasn't ready to recommend investors buy up more shares of tech stocks, saying he didn't believe prices have come down enough to make the group compelling. Instead, he is recommending clients scoop up shares of industrial and financial companies, which he finds ""unduly cheap"" right now based in part on their price-to-earnings ratios. Elsewhere, renewed hopes that trade tensions between the U.S. and China are de-escalating and a strong October jobs report gave investors reason to be more optimistic. President Trump tweeted Thursday about what he called a ""long and very good conversation"" with his counterpart in China, Xi Jinping, helping push shares higher in Europe and Asia. ""While we are still cautious over a full resolution of recent tensions in the medium term, resumption of dialogue between Washington and Beijing would be good enough to investors for now,"" said Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. And the October jobs report buttressed the argument that the U.S. economy remains on strong footing, as the Labor Department reported that hiring accelerated last month and the unemployment rate held at a 49-year low. Wages increased 3.1% from a year earlier, the best year-over-year gain for average hourly earnings since 2009, data showed. But what is good for the economy doesn't always translate to positive news for stock investors, as many worry that rises in wages could hurt corporate profit margins and lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly than expected. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 3.214% versus 3.144% on Thursday. Yields move inversely to prices. Stocks across Europe advanced, with the Stoxx Europe 600 up 0.3%, following larger rises in Asia. Meanwhile, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rose 2.6%, China's Shenzhen A Share Index gained 3.4% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rallied 4.2%. Sarah E.

Apple,Stocks End Mostly Lower as Apple Closes Stores,19 June 2020,Dow Jones Institutional News,960 words,0.9647,0.078,0.059,0.863,"English , Inc. The Dow Jones Industrial Average abruptly turned lower Friday after Apple said it was closing some stores due to a rise in coronavirus cases, stoking fears of another lockdown. During a choppy day of trading, the Dow rallied at the opening bell, swung more than 600 points on the Apple news, then staged a partial comeback in the last hour of the session. In the end, the blue-chip index closed down 208.64 points, or 0.8%, at 25871.46. The S&P 500 dropped 17.60 points, or 0.6%, to 3097.74. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 3.07 points, or less than 0.1%, to 9946.12. All three indexes posted weekly gains of at least 1%, reversing a sharp drop last week. The increases were fueled by central-bank stimulus efforts and cautious optimism that the economy is recovering from the worst fallout of the pandemic. Still, investors have been sensitive to any indications of a second wave of infections, out of fear that it could lead to new lockdowns, reversing the trend toward reopening the U.S. economy that has lifted the stock market since it bottomed out in March. Apple said Friday that it was temporarily shutting 11 stores across Florida, Arizona, North Carolina and South Carolina, following spikes in Covid-19 infections. The market sold off sharply on the news. Earlier in the week, investors had been cheered by a string of economic data suggesting that the U.S. economy is recovering, with retail sales rebounding and jobless claims easing. ""The things you saw in March -- the panic and forced selling -- all seem to have faded, so it's a bit more of a normal market, though a fragile one,"" said Jonas Golterman, senior markets economist at Capital Economics. ""The ingrained reflex which we have had in the past 10 years is, we have to buy the dip, and that usually works out."" Early coronavirus testing data from U.S. states and cities, including Minnesota, where the police killing of George Floyd sparked global protests, suggest recent mass gatherings haven't led to a marked uptick in new cases. New cases in Florida, Arizona and California have hit daily record highs in recent days, but authorities have been reluctant to put lockdown measures back in place. Authorities in California are requiring residents to wear face masks in high-risk settings. Investors have cheered signs that the U.S. economy is reopening, allowing people to return to work and business activity to pick up. ""At the moment, people just seemed very focused on the strength of the recovery, which is to be expected given the strength of the shutdown,"" said Lyn Graham-Taylor, fixed-income strategist at Rabobank. ""Through the summer, the economic data will be mechanically good just because it's going off such a low base, so it will take time to find out what the economic scarring is."" Markets have also gotten a boost from the stimulus efforts of central banks, with the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank all stepping up efforts in recent weeks to buy bonds and inject money into their economies to alleviate the impact of the pandemic. Some analysts cited fear of missing out as another driver behind this week's gains. ""We suspect there are a lot of people who sold at the bottom, and now they have regret and remorse over not buying sooner,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Potentially adding to volatility Friday was quadruple witching, which occurs four times a year and refers to the day that options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire at the same time. That tends to cause heavy trading volume as traders adjust expiring positions. Ten of the S&P 500's 11 sectors were negative Friday. Health care was the only sector in positive territory. Shares of Apple dropped $2.01, or 0.6%, to $349.72. The stock hit a record intraday high on Friday morning before the news of its store closures. AMC Entertainment fell 11 cents, or 2%, to $5.52 in a volatile day of trading. The cinema chain reported plans late Thursday to reopen most of its movie theaters in July, sending its stock up. But shares turned lower after the company said it would require moviegoers to wear masks, a reversal of its earlier stance. CarMax shares tumbled $6.04, or 6.2%, to $91.87 after the auto retailer reported that its profit for the last quarter contracted sharply amid the pandemic. Oil prices rose to a three-month high. New York crude futures climbed 2.3% to settle at $39.75. New data showed a further decline in the count of U.S. oil rigs, a bullish sign for the energy markets as it shows oil drillers are reining in production. Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 climbed 0.6%. Most major Asian markets closed higher. The Shanghai Composite rallied 1%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note settled at 0.696%, up from 0.693% Thursday.

Apple,The Dow Jones Industrial Average abruptly turned lower Friday after Apple said...,19 June 2020,Dow Jones Institutional News,951 words,0.9647,0.078,0.059,0.863,"English , Inc. The Dow Jones Industrial Average abruptly turned lower Friday after Apple said it was closing some stores due to a rise in coronavirus cases, stoking fears of another lockdown. During a choppy day of trading, the Dow rallied at the opening bell, swung more than 600 points on the Apple news, then staged a partial comeback in the last hour of the session. In the end, the blue-chip index closed down 208.64 points, or 0.8%, at 25871.46. The S&P 500 dropped 17.60 points, or 0.6%, to 3097.74. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 3.07 points, or less than 0.1%, to 9946.12. All three indexes posted weekly gains of at least 1%, reversing a sharp drop last week. The increases were fueled by central-bank stimulus efforts and cautious optimism that the economy is recovering from the worst fallout of the pandemic. Still, investors have been sensitive to any indications of a second wave of infections, out of fear that it could lead to new lockdowns, reversing the trend toward reopening the U.S. economy that has lifted the stock market since it bottomed out in March. Apple said Friday that it was temporarily shutting 11 stores across Florida, Arizona, North Carolina and South Carolina, following spikes in Covid-19 infections. The market sold off sharply on the news. Earlier in the week, investors had been cheered by a string of economic data suggesting that the U.S. economy is recovering, with retail sales rebounding and jobless claims easing. ""The things you saw in March -- the panic and forced selling -- all seem to have faded, so it's a bit more of a normal market, though a fragile one,"" said Jonas Golterman, senior markets economist at Capital Economics. ""The ingrained reflex which we have had in the past 10 years is, we have to buy the dip, and that usually works out."" Early coronavirus testing data from U.S. states and cities, including Minnesota, where the police killing of George Floyd sparked global protests, suggest recent mass gatherings haven't led to a marked uptick in new cases. New cases in Florida, Arizona and California have hit daily record highs in recent days, but authorities have been reluctant to put lockdown measures back in place. Authorities in California are requiring residents to wear face masks in high-risk settings. Investors have cheered signs that the U.S. economy is reopening, allowing people to return to work and business activity to pick up. ""At the moment, people just seemed very focused on the strength of the recovery, which is to be expected given the strength of the shutdown,"" said Lyn Graham-Taylor, fixed-income strategist at Rabobank. ""Through the summer, the economic data will be mechanically good just because it's going off such a low base, so it will take time to find out what the economic scarring is."" Markets have also gotten a boost from the stimulus efforts of central banks, with the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank all stepping up efforts in recent weeks to buy bonds and inject money into their economies to alleviate the impact of the pandemic. Some analysts cited fear of missing out as another driver behind this week's gains. ""We suspect there are a lot of people who sold at the bottom, and now they have regret and remorse over not buying sooner,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Potentially adding to volatility Friday was quadruple witching, which occurs four times a year and refers to the day that options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire at the same time. That tends to cause heavy trading volume as traders adjust expiring positions. Ten of the S&P 500's 11 sectors were negative Friday. Health care was the only sector in positive territory. Shares of Apple dropped $2.01, or 0.6%, to $349.72. The stock hit a record intraday high on Friday morning before the news of its store closures. AMC Entertainment fell 11 cents, or 2%, to $5.52 in a volatile day of trading. The cinema chain reported plans late Thursday to reopen most of its movie theaters in July, sending its stock up. But shares turned lower after the company said it would require moviegoers to wear masks, a reversal of its earlier stance. CarMax shares tumbled $6.04, or 6.2%, to $91.87 after the auto retailer reported that its profit for the last quarter contracted sharply amid the pandemic. Oil prices rose to a three-month high. New York crude futures climbed 2.3% to settle at $39.75. New data showed a further decline in the count of U.S. oil rigs, a bullish sign for the energy markets as it shows oil drillers are reining in production. Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 climbed 0.6%. Most major Asian markets closed higher. The Shanghai Composite rallied 1%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note settled at 0.696%, up from 0.693% Thursday.

Apple,WSJ Pro,30 April 2020,WSJ Pro Cybersecurity,"1,071 words",0.2648,0.063,0.063,0.874,"English , Inc. Governments and companies are planning to introduce mobile applications that use Bluetooth to track coronavirus infections. Researchers say the technology keeps users' identifying data private, but the complexity of working with Bluetooth raises cybersecurity concerns. Bluetooth, a widely used technology for connecting devices, has emerged as the technology of choice for tracking the spread of the coronavirus, as the U.S. and European countries decide how to safely reopen businesses in the coming weeks and months. European governments including France, the U.K. and Germany said in recent weeks that they are developing Bluetooth-based mobile apps to notify individuals who came close to someone who has the virus. Singapore and Australia are already using Bluetooth-based tracing apps. Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google said this month they are working on a Bluetooth system that developers can use to build tracing apps while protecting users' privacy. Security and privacy researchers say there are advantages, along with potential risks, to using Bluetooth. It reveals less detailed information about a person's location than other technologies, such as GPS. But Bluetooth's specifications are several thousand pages long, and that complexity can lead to mistakes by developers, said Ben Seri, vice president for research at cybersecurity firm Armis Inc. In November, a researcher from the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany found a vulnerability in how Bluetooth was implemented on devices using Google's Android operating system. Google issued a patch in February. The problem could have allowed hackers to launch remote cyberattacks. In 2017, Mr. Seri discovered a security problem in how mobile devices handled Bluetooth signals. Hackers could have exploited the bug to move between devices using Bluetooth connections. Apple, Google and other companies issued patches to fix the problem in devices' operating systems. Such flaws are becoming less common as companies improve how they implement Bluetooth, said Mr. Seri. If many people start using tracing apps, there could be more devices that enable Bluetooth all the time. Creative hackers might look for devices with Bluetooth turned on in their vicinity and try to launch remote cyberattacks, said Eliot Bendinelli, a technologist at London-based nonprofit Privacy International. Apple and Google have said app developers that use their technology must comply with their privacy and security criteria. For example, users must opt in to share their data. Public health authorities would receive a list of Bluetooth beacons showing devices that were in contact with users who have coronavirus. The app that France plans to deploy by May 11 won't be able to work on iPhones the way the government intended because Apple appears to prevent the transfer of data collected by Bluetooth coronavirus apps from a device to centralized servers, the country's Digital Minister Cédric O told Bloomberg last week. He said he asked Apple to change the policy. Apple and Google declined to comment on France's complaint. A Google spokesman referred to the two companies' publication last week of updates to their system that they say will protect privacy and make it more difficult to identify individuals. This includes encrypting the Bluetooth metadata that phones share when they connect using the technology. Representatives of the companies said Wednesday their technology will let public-health authorities assign users different risk levels and tailor the notifications they send to people accordingly. The risk level will be based on users' proximity and duration of exposure to known coronavirus carriers, and will be calculated on users' devices for privacy and security reasons. Bluetooth connects devices by changing signals periodically to hide users' unique addresses. The feature is designed to protect privacy, but it could be possible for data to be exposed when a mobile phone connects with other devices nearby, according to a paper published last year by Boston University researchers. It is unclear whether other apps installed on a phone could collect data from a coronavirus tracing app, David Starobinski, a Boston University professor in electrical and computer engineering who wrote the research, said in an interview. The 2019 paper was published before the coronavirus outbreak and didn't refer to contact-tracing apps. Individuals would be more secure using a second phone for contact tracing, he said. ""Ideally, we'd have a different device that's more isolated from other services,"" he said. Technical limitations Aside from potential security risks, Bluetooth may not be a perfect technology for tracing which people have come close enough to transmit the coronavirus. Developers of the original Bluetooth protocol said the technology wasn't designed to generate detailed, reliable data about proximity between devices. ""The accuracy is limited,"" said Sven Mattisson, one of the engineers who designed the concept for Bluetooth in 1995 when he worked at Ericsson AB. ""You might interpret a false contact in a parking lot because you get such a strong signal back, even though the contact is far away. But if you're in an office space, you might not receive a signal,"" said Mr. Mattisson, who is now an adjunct professor in microelectronics at Lund University in Sweden. Signals might be strong in an open space with few people even if they are far apart, but they may be weaker in a crowded enclosed area. A Bluetooth-based contact-tracing app that sends a signal when two users are close to each other might not recognize when they are separated by a window or walls, the Australian law firm Maddocks wrote last week in a privacy assessment of the country's app. The Australian health ministry said in response that it is seeking advice about the use of Bluetooth from the country's cybersecurity agency. But the ubiquity of Bluetooth is an advantage amid a pandemic, said Jaap Haartsen, who developed the technology with Mr. Mattisson. It could take years to roll out mobile technology that could be better suited to tracing contacts, he said. Mr. Haartsen is now chief scientist for wireless technologies at Plantronics Inc.'s Poly, a communications services company. ""It was not made for tracing, but at least it can give an indication [of] which other phones have been in close range,"" he said in an email. (""mailto:Catherine.Stupp@wsj.com"")"

Apple is among the most recognizable U.S. brands in China, a country that it relies on heavily for manufacturing and sales. The Cupertino, Calif.-based giant was lambasted for approving the app and accused of showing support for the protesters. Critics say HKmap.live--which denotes the presence of police with an emoji of a dog, a widely used insult for police officers during the protests--will help protesters commit crimes and evade arrest.

A dinosaur emoji warns of the elite snatch-and-arrest police squads known ""raptors."" According to the developer's Twitter account, @hkmaplive, Apple earlier this month blocked the app from going on sale on its App Store, saying that it could be used to evade law enforcement. Days later, on Oct. 4, the developer said the app had been approved by Apple. ""I don't think the application is illegal in Hong Kong,"" the app's developer said in an interview, saying that it merely consolidates information that is publicly available--for example on Telegram, an app that protesters have been using to communicate. The developer declined to give his or her name, citing safety concerns. Little is known about the developer, who is soliciting donations via bitcoin, the anonymized cryptocurrency, to support the app and other projects. The Chinese Communist Party's Youth League on Tuesday drew attention to HKmap.live after it criticized the app, and Apple, on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service. The post solicited criticisms from Chinese online users. ""Support the Chinese brands and time to take Apple off the shelf, "" said one user. On Weibo, a hashtag that accuses Apple of helping publicize the movements of Hong Kong police had been viewed about 14 million times by Wednesday afternoon.

Apple declined to comment on the review process for HKmap.live. Apple's business model has been subjected to heavy scrutiny throughout the continuing U.S.-China trade war, which began last year. A reliance on the Chinese market leaves Apple exposed should Beijing decide to retaliate against the U.S. by fanning nationalistic sentiments among consumers to squeeze sales of American goods.

Apple,Apple Counts on 5G to Boost iPhone Fortunes in China,14 October 2020,Dow Jones Institutional News,946 words,0.9764,0.084,0.05,0.866,"English , Inc. Apple Inc. is playing catch-up in China with the launch of its first 5G-enabled iPhones, seeking to supercharge uneven sales in the company’s second-biggest market—where homegrown rivals dominate. Apple’s first 5G-enabled handset is a late entry in China, where local brands have long offered a suite of 5G-ready gadgets to use on the nation’s up-and-running next generation networks. It launched as China’s economy is rebounding faster than the rest of the world after it contained the coronavirus pandemic, but also at a time of increasing technology nationalism among some Chinese consumers amid heightened trade tensions with the U.S. A crucial battle for Apple is in the premium smartphone market Apple once ruled before losing ground to Huawei Technologies Co. in recent years. On Tuesday Apple unveiled four versions of the iPhone 12 capable of connecting to ultrafast 5G networks. The new devices offer a retro design and prices roughly in line with last year’s iPhone 11, though a smaller 5.4-inch iPhone 12 Mini starts at $699 in the U.S. At an Apple store in downtown Shanghai on Wednesday, the new iPhone wasn’t yet on display nor were any promotional posters, two days before the new device was available for preorder. Still, some Chinese consumers said they were excited about Apple’s first 5G handset, and said they didn’t expect the trade tensions between Washington and Beijing to sway their purchase decision. “I think the overall upgrade on image and video function is quite significant this time,” said Zhefan Shen, a 27-year-old who works for an internet company in Shanghai and has recently used Chinese-brand phones. After watching the iPhone launch event, he said he plans to buy the iPhone 12 Mini. “I am a firm fan of small screens,” he said. The flip side of Apple’s wait to enter the 5G-handset market is pent-up demand among committed iPhone fans in the country, analysts say. Wedbush Securities estimates about 20% of iPhone upgrades will come from China over the next year. “We’ll definitely see a boost” in iPhone sales following the launch, said Duncan Clark, chairman of investment adviser BDA China. Homegrown rivals have been chipping away at Apple’s market share in China for years, though the launch of its second-generation iPhone SE gave shipments a 14.1% lift during the first half of the year, according to market tracker Canalys, as the broader smartphone market in China contracted. Apple’s revenue in its Greater China region fell 3.1% in the first half of the year to $18.8 billion, while its overall revenue rose 5.5% in the same period. A worrisome trend for Apple is its shrinking share of China’s market for high-end handsets. In 2017, Apple dominated the premium $600-and-up smartphone market with an 86% share, versus Huawei’s 5%, according to Canalys. But in the first half of 2020, Huawei controlled almost half the market, while Apple had fallen to 42%. “In China’s premium market, there are only two vendors: Apple and Huawei,” said Mo Jia, an analyst at Canalys. Huawei is set to launch its latest flagship device, the Mate 40, later this month, likely further juicing sales in the short term, though the effect could fade as U.S. tech restrictions bite. Apple faces a challenge in the deepening trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Washington has added dozens of Chinese companies, including Huawei, to its export blacklist. More recently, the Trump administration has cracked down on popular Chinese apps, including Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat and ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok. Beijing is threatening to release its own “unreliable entity” list to punish U.S. tech firms in response. Allegra Li, a 28-year-old freelance translator and a loyal Apple fan in the central city of Changsha, said many of her friends have switched to Huawei phones amid the tensions. “Although some of them liked Apple very much before, they now try to use Huawei as much as possible,” she said. For Mr. Shen, the tech skirmish between the two countries is irrelevant. “As an ordinary consumer, even if I buy one less Apple device, this will not have any impact on the bigger picture,” he said. “I just want to use a product happily.” Apple’s roots in China, however, run deep. It relies heavily on China’s huge electronics factories to churn out iPhones and other gadgets. Apple curates its app store in China to stay on Beijing’s good side, a practice that has riled some free-speech activists but that analysts said have helped it survive in a country from which other U.S. tech giants have retreated. “It’s such a resistant company to geopolitical shifts,” Mr. Clark of BDA China said concerning Apple. “If they come down, or they are taken down [in China], then it’s a sign that U.S.-China relations have really broken down.” Apple continues to have a stable of loyal fans in China who will reliably flock to the new iPhone now that it is 5G enabled and comes at an accessible price point, said Neil Shah, analyst at Counterpoint Research. “Except for Apple, everyone has” a 5G phone on the market, Mr. Shah said. “Now that it has 5G capability, that will work heavily in Apple’s favor.” (END) Dow Jones Newswires October 14, 2020 (13:20 GMT)"
Apple,Apple and the iPhone Near Trade Crosshairs Again,11 May 2019,Dow Jones Institutional News,950 words,0.9615,0.086,0.068,0.846,"English , Inc. Renewed trade tensions between the U.S. and China threaten to throw Apple Inc. back into the global trade battle, putting its iPhone business at risk just as the tech giant appeared to be shoring up declining sales of its most important product. The round of tariff increases that hit Friday don't directly affect iPhones, iPads, Macs or Apple Watches. But President Trump this week threatened a tariff of 25% on $325 billion in Chinese imports that haven't previously been targeted by duties. Those would cover virtually all Chinese exports to the U.S., including Apple's most important devices. ""Build your products in the United States and there are NO TARIFFS!"" Mr. Trump said Friday on Twitter. Apple has faced minimal impact from previous tariffs on about $200 billion in Chinese goods, which covered electronic circuit boards, computer chips, chemicals and other parts. However, the iPhone maker is among the companies most exposed to future tariffs because it assembles almost all of its products in China. Tariffs could add to gadget prices or cut into profits by forcing Apple to absorb the additional costs. Apple also counts on Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, for about a fifth of its sales, making it vulnerable if China retaliates with higher duties or punitive actions against American companies. Apple would be a likely target because of the iPhone's 7.4% share of China's smartphone market, analysts say. ""If Trump actually goes the last round, they're in big trouble,"" Mary Lovely, an economist at Syracuse University, said of the iPhone maker. She said a host of other consumer-facing products would face the same fate, including apparel and electronics. Shares of Apple fell 7% this week, as trade concerns mounted. They finished Friday at $197.18 The trade tensions intensified Friday when the Trump administration increased tariffs to 25% from 10% on $200 billion in Chinese goods, claiming China had backtracked on commitments made during months of trade negotiations. The setback jeopardized a potential trade agreement, as China threatened countermeasures to the U.S. tariffs. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has been in touch with the Trump administration throughout the trade dispute. He also has tried to play down tensions publicly, telling analysts repeatedly over the past year that he was optimistic about trade negotiations. ""These trade relationships are big and complex, and they clearly do need a level of focus and a level of updating and modernization,"" Mr. Cook said in November. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. The Trump administration last year spared Apple's smartwatch and AirPods wireless earbuds from planned tariffs. The escalating battle this week comes amid an abrupt downturn in Apple's iPhone business. Apple last month posted its first back-to-back drop in quarterly sales and profit in more than two years as iPhone sales sank 16% in the first half of its fiscal year. Many iPhone owners are holding on to existing devices, turned off by higher prices and less interested in new features. In the U.S., a tariff of 25% on a Chinese-made iPhone XS could exacerbate that problem by adding about $160 in costs to the $999 device, according to Morgan Stanley. Apple could either pass that cost on to consumers -- potentially causing people to hold off on buying new iPhones -- or absorb it, reducing its per-share earnings by 23% in fiscal year 2020, the firm estimates. Shipments of iPhones to North America, Apple's largest market, fell 19% to 14.6 million units in the quarter ended March 30, according to Canalys, a market research firm. Apple faces similar risks in China, where iPhone declines have been more pronounced. The iPhone has been losing share to Chinese rivals that offer lower-priced devices with increasingly sophisticated features. The company's sales in Greater China fell 25% in the first half of fiscal 2019. In April, Mr. Cook said iPhone sales improved in the most recent quarter after the Chinese government took steps to stimulate the economy by reducing its value-added tax on iPhones and other goods to 13% from 16%. Should the Chinese government retaliate against U.S. tariff increases, analysts say it could reverse that value-added tax relief. It also could target other aspects of Apple's business, including its roughly 40 retail stores in China and its App Store. There is also the potential that Chinese consumers might put off buying Apple devices in a show of national support, analysts say. ""It would be a big symbolic thing to go after Apple, and there are all kinds of tricks they can play,"" said Claude Barfield, a resident at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. He added that would carry risks for the Chinese because of how many people Apple employs in China -- an estimated three million people through its supply chain. Apple has taken measures in recent months to diversify its supply chain. Its largest iPhone assembler, Foxconn Technology Group, has studied whether to begin producing the devices in India. The move would reduce Apple's dependence on China for manufacturing and help it avoid U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. It would take Apple time to ramp production quickly in India or any other market, analysts say, making it unlikely the company could avoid U.S. tariffs this year. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services. (END) Dow Jones Newswires May 11, 2019 (12:00 GMT)"

Apple reached the milestone when it climbed above $207.04 in midday trading. The stock has risen 23% so far this year, its latest rally coming after it reported strong revenue and profit gains Tuesday as demand for high-price iPhones remained resilient and sales from the app store and other services hit all-time highs. Apple’s rise has been propelled by the sustained success of the iPhone developed under late co-founder Steve Jobs, a product visionary who helped revive the company from a death spiral in the late 1990s. His successor, Tim Cook, has turned Apple into a cash-generating giant by pushing its existing products to prominence in China and cultivating its rapidly growing services business—moves that have helped stave off concerns about the absence of a new, blockbuster device. “We’ve heard a number of times since Mr. Jobs died that the company was going to slip and fall, but they’ve continued to execute,” said Greg Hersch, founder of New York City-based Florence Capital Advisors, which has more than $400 million under management and counts Apple among its largest holdings. Along the way, Apple has led a broader tech boom that has made a handful of giant companies central in people’s daily lives and investment portfolios. The five most valuable companies—Apple, Amazon.com Inc., Google parent AlphabetInc., MicrosoftCorp. and FacebookInc.—are all tech and internet firms, a level of industry dominance rare in recent markets history. Those five collectively accounted for nearly 15% of the total value of the S&P 500 as of last month, according to Ned Davis Research. The iPhone, and the smartphone era it birthed, helped lift other tech giants—and disrupted many other businesses. Smartphones drive mobile advertising businesses at Google and Facebook, and account for an increasing share of the e-commerce transactions lifting Amazon. Technology’s ubiquity, and the industry’s swelling wealth and clout, also have triggered growing criticism and regulatory scrutiny—one of several factors that could undermine the boom. This year, Apple confronted investor pressure to address the public health risks of rising youth smartphone addiction. Facebook and Google were grilled by U.S. lawmakers over data privacy. Amazon’s business practices were slammed by President Donald Trump. Some money managers worry that a few highflying firms are powering the broader market, leaving stocks susceptible to a painful downturn if the rally ends. Apple, founded as an upstart maker of personal computers in 1976, first took the crown as the largest company in August 2011 when it edged out Exxon Mobil Corp., signifying tech’s displacement of energy as market king. At the time, Apple was valued at roughly $343 billion. Mr. Jobs died a few months later, having transformed the company from a niche computer company to a global electronics powerhouse. But Apple kept rising, cementing its market-cap lead in August 2013 and holding it consistently since then except for a few days in 2016 when Alphabet was bigger. More recently, Apple has had to hold off Amazon, which was worth just a third of Apple’s value in 2011 but whose stock recently has surged as it shows it can grow profit as well as sales. Amazon was worth about $890 billion on Thursday, and Alphabet was worth about $860 billion. Microsoft, at more than $825 billion, isn’t far behind. The calculation of Apple’s market value is based on the company’s share count as of July 20. Share counts fluctuate day by day based on factors like stock buybacks, but generally aren’t disclosed more than a few times a year. Apple isn’t the world’s first company to claim the $1 trillion title. In 2007, PetroChinaCo.’s market cap surpassed that level by some measures, though the Chinese oil and gas producer’s corporate structure kept most of its shares locked up in government hands, making it difficult to determine the firm’s actual value. Outside of the public markets, there is Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the state-owned oil company. It weighed an initial public offering that could value the business at as much as $2 trillion. The plan has stalled however, and the actual value of the company, known as Saudi Aramco, isn’t clear. Apple’s ascent is especially remarkable since its survival as a company was in doubt just over two decades ago. It lost $2 billion over two years in the mid-1990s, weighed a sale to Sun Microsystems, and churned through three CEOs in four years before bringing back Mr. Jobs. He revived the business by thinning Apple’s product lineup and spearheading a trio of hits: the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Mr. Cook, who took over in 2011, broadened the iPhone’s reach, helping it become one of the best-selling products in history, with more than 1.4 billion devices sold. Huge numbers were sold in China, a market that exploded in 2015 after Apple signed a deal with the largest mobile operator. China now accounts for a fifth of Apple’s sales. The iPhone also underpinned Apple’s services sales, which Mr. Cook set the goal of doubling in four years to $50 billion by 2020. On Tuesday, he said Apple is on track to hit that goal thanks to accelerating subscription sales, growing transactions on Apple Pay and other factors. The iPhone X, which launched last November, has delivered minimal unit growth, but its $999 price tag has lifted total sales by raising average iPhone selling prices 15% higher to $750 in the nine months ended in June. In May, Apple announced it would add $100 billion in share repurchases, the largest ever announced by a company. Unlike some peers that trade at lofty multiples, Apple is still relatively cheap based on its current performance. Some investors worry about the escalating trade dispute between the U.S. and China however. Apple acknowledged this week that those tensions could increase its manufacturing costs and dampen product sales. In the longer term, investors worry about Apple’s ability to launch another transformational product like the iPhone. Its smartwatch, which debuted in 2015, made Apple the world’s largest watch company by sales but hasn’t delivered the same type of boost that other hit products have. “One of the things that has always concerned us is the concentration in the iPhone,” said Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners, which owns the stock. “But I don’t think there is a risk that there is some gee-whiz product in the next 12 to 24 months that is going to unseat the iPhone as the king.” and Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires August 02, 2018 (16:00 GMT)"

Apple,Apple and the iPhone Near Trade Crosshairs Again,13 May 2019,Dow Jones Institutional News,946 words,0.9615,0.086,0.069,0.845,"English , Inc. Renewed trade tensions between the U.S. and China threaten to throw Apple Inc. back into the global trade battle, putting its iPhone business at risk just as the tech giant appeared to be shoring up declining sales of its most important product. The round of tariff increases that hit Friday don’t directly affect iPhones, iPads, Macs or Apple Watches. But President Trump this week threatened a tariff of 25% on $325 billion in Chinese imports that haven’t previously been targeted by duties. Those would cover virtually all Chinese exports to the U.S., including Apple’s most important devices. “Build your products in the United States and there are NO TARIFFS!” Mr. Trump said Friday on Twitter. Apple has faced minimal impact from previous tariffs on about $200 billion in Chinese goods, which covered electronic circuit boards, computer chips, chemicals and other parts. However, the iPhone maker is among the companies most exposed to future tariffs because it assembles almost all of its products in China. Tariffs could add to gadget prices or cut into profits by forcing Apple to absorb the additional costs. Apple also counts on Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, for about a fifth of its sales, making it vulnerable if China retaliates with higher duties or punitive actions against American companies. Apple would be a likely target because of the iPhone’s 7.4% share of China’s smartphone market, analysts say. “If Trump actually goes the last round, they’re in big trouble,” Mary Lovely, an economist at Syracuse University, said of the iPhone maker. She said a host of other consumer-facing products would face the same fate, including apparel and electronics. Shares of Apple fell 7% this week, as trade concerns mounted. They finished Friday at $197.18 The trade tensions intensified Friday when the Trump administration increased tariffs to 25% from 10% on $200 billion in Chinese goods, claiming China had backtracked on commitments made during months of trade negotiations. The setback jeopardized a potential trade agreement, as China threatened countermeasures to the U.S. tariffs. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has been in touch with the Trump administration throughout the trade dispute. He also has tried to play down tensions publicly, telling analysts repeatedly over the past year that he was optimistic about trade negotiations. “These trade relationships are big and complex, and they clearly do need a level of focus and a level of updating and modernization,” Mr. Cook said in November. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. The Trump administration last year spared Apple’s smartwatch and AirPodswireless earbuds from planned tariffs. The escalating battle this week comes amid an abrupt downturn in Apple’s iPhone business. Apple last month posted its first back-to-back drop in quarterly sales and profit in more than two years as iPhone sales sank 16% in the first half of its fiscal year. Many iPhone owners are holding on to existing devices, turned off by higher prices and less interested in new features. In the U.S., a tariff of 25% on a Chinese-made iPhone XS could exacerbate that problem by adding about $160 in costs to the $999 device, according to Morgan Stanley. Apple could either pass that cost on to consumers—potentially causing people to hold off on buying new iPhones—or absorb it, reducing its per-share earnings by 23% in fiscal year 2020, the firm estimates. Shipments of iPhones to North America, Apple’s largest market, fell 19% to 14.6 million units in the quarter ended March 30, according to Canalys, a market research firm. Apple faces similar risks in China, where iPhone declines have been more pronounced. The iPhone has been losing share to Chinese rivals that offer lower-priced devices with increasingly sophisticated features. The company’s sales in Greater China fell 25% in the first half of fiscal 2019. In April, Mr. Cook said iPhone sales improved in the most recent quarter after the Chinese government took steps to stimulate the economy by reducing its value-added tax on iPhones and other goods to 13% from 16%. Should the Chinese government retaliate against U.S. tariff increases, analysts say it could reverse that value-added tax relief. It also could target other aspects of Apple’s business, including its roughly 40 retail stores in China and its App Store. There is also the potential that Chinese consumers might put off buying Apple devices in a show of national support, analysts say. “It would be a big symbolic thing to go after Apple, and there are all kinds of tricks they can play,” said Claude Barfield, a resident at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. He added that would carry risks for the Chinese because of how many people Apple employs in China—an estimated three million people through its supply chain. Apple has taken measures in recent months to diversify its supply chain. Its largest iPhone assembler, Foxconn Technology Group, has studied whether to begin producing the devices in India. The move would reduce Apple’s dependence on China for manufacturing and help it avoid U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. It would take Apple time to ramp production quickly in India or any other market, analysts say, making it unlikely the company could avoid U.S. tariffs this year. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services. (END) Dow Jones Newswires May 12, 2019 (01:10 GMT)"
Apple,"Apple Avoids Tariffs on Smartwatches, Earbuds",17 September 2018,Dow Jones Institutional News,953 words,-0.9831,0.045,0.084,0.87,"English , Inc. AppleInc. dodged stinging duties on its smartwatches and wireless earbuds after the U.S. excluded those gadgets from tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods, though the tech giant still faces retaliatory measures being weighed by China that could strike iPhone production there. The trade tensions are rattling companies in a range of industries, but Apple’s heavy dependence on the U.S. and China makes it especially vulnerable as the world’s two largest powers escalate their economic feud. Because Apple assembles almost all of its gadgets in China, its watches, AirPods and other devices are vulnerable to the Trump administration’s plans to widen the scope of tariffs on Chinese imports—a risk Apple warned about earlier this month. That reliance also could make the iPhone and other devices vulnerable if Chinese officials follow through on retaliatory moves to restrict sales of materials, equipment and parts key to U.S. manufacturers—measures The Wall Street Journal on Sunday reported that Beijing is considering. The timing of the countries’ new measures could be especially bad for Apple, which this week starts shipping two of its three new iPhones and a new smartwatch. Those new devices are expected to help fuel the company’s sales in the final three months of the year, when Christmas shopping helps deliver about one-third of Apple’s annual revenue. China’s threatened retaliatory moves in particular “could be fairly devastating,” said Mark Vena, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, a technology research firm. He said Apple should have enough inventory of key components for iPhones and smartwatches to maintain production through the holidays, but in the long term, Chinese retaliation “could be a serious problem.” In a statement Monday, the Trump administration said it would respond to any retaliatory action by China with another round of tariffs on approximately $267 billion of Chinese imports. The Trump administration’s break for smartwatches and wireless headphones, which were slated to be hit by 10% tariffs starting Sept. 24, come at a critical moment for Apple. The company this week starts shipping a new smartwatch along with two of its three new iPhones. Those new devices are expected to help fuel Apple’s sales in the final three months of the year, when holiday shopping helps deliver about one-third of annual revenue. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cookhas urged Mr. Trump to avoid a trade battle, saying it would hurt U.S. companies. Mr. Cook had expressed optimism during a July call with analysts that the trade dispute would “get sorted out” because each country needs the other to prosper. But Apple early this month said in a filing with the U.S. Trade Representative that the administration’s planned tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods would hit its smartwatches and wireless AirPods headphones. In the U.S., the proposed tariffs of 10% would have added more than $11 to the import cost of about $115 for a Chinese-made Apple Watch Series 3, according to market researcher IHS Markit. Analysts say Apple would either eat those costs on the device, which retails for $269—and similar costs on other products such as AirPods—or pass the costs on to retailers and consumers. “Apple’s profit margins are very healthy,” so the company could have withstood the tariffs better than most, said Wayne Lam, an analyst with IHS Markit. Still, he said absorbing the costs of the tariffs would have reduced Apple’s gross margins on its smartwatch, which are now more than 40%. The Trump administration’s decision to spare smartwatches and wireless headphones comes despite the president’s suggestion the only way Apple products would be spared would be if the company started making its products in the U.S. He called on Apple in a tweet last week to “start building new plants now.” Though the U.S. removed smartwatches and wireless headphones, it estimates the tariffs will still affect about $200 billion in goods when they are implemented. Other products that came off the list included chemical inputs, bike helmets and child-safety furniture such as high chairs and playpens. Those planned tariffs, and others already imposed on about $50 billion of Chinese imports, don’t affect the iPhone, which accounts for about two-thirds of Apple’s total sales. That could change for the iPhone if the Trump administration follows through with earlier threats to expand its levies to a total of $500 billion in imports, or nearly all the goods the U.S. gets from China. A big risk is possible Chinese retaliation, said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Sales in China accounts for about one-fifth of Apple’s total revenue, and trade experts, and analysts have long feared the country could increase the value-added tax of 16% it already levies on iPhones and other goods. A move to block suppliers from delivering key components to Apple “is the embodiment of the worst-case scenario,” said Mr. Sacconaghi. Apple’s supply chain is so established in China that “there’s no short-term workaround,” he said. China will have to be sensitive to how any such retaliation might affect Chinese workers. Apple employs about 10,000 people directly in China and indirectly accounts for three million jobs there through its supply chain. In the U.S., Apple directly employs about 80,000 people and claims responsibility for two million jobs around the country, including those of suppliers, app developers and entrepreneurs who offer products across its devices.

Apple,"Apple Sues Israeli Firm NSO Over Spyware, Claiming iPhone Hacks -- 3rd Update",23 November 2021,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,823 words",-0.9947,0.066,0.13,0.804,"English , Inc. Apple Inc. has sued the NSO Group, an Israeli maker of surveillance software, alleging the company misused its products and services, escalating battle over surveillance and user privacy. The lawsuit alleges that NSO Group engaged in ""concerted efforts in 2021 to target and attack Apple customers, Apple products and servers and Apple through dangerous malware and spyware,"" and seeks to bar NSO Group from using Apple's products. Critics and privacy advocates for years have alleged that NSO Group and similar firms sell hacking tools to governments with poor track records on human rights, allegations the company has denied. The Israeli company has developed hacking techniques to install its surveillance software, called Pegasus, on Apple's mobile phones without a user's knowledge or consent, according to security researchers. Pegasus, they say, turns the iPhone into a silent spying device by gaining access to the device's files, messages, microphone and camera. Apple's lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, is another salvo in an emerging strategy against the surveillance techniques. In the past, Apple and other companies would use bug fixes and security enhancements to patch vulnerabilities and render such software unusable. Now, litigation and government pressure is increasingly becoming another tool to curtail its use. In 2019, the WhatsApp messaging service sued NSO Group, alleging that the company sent malware to 1,400 of its users. WhatsApp is owned by Meta Platforms Inc., formerly known as Facebook Inc. An NSO Group spokesman didn't address Apple's allegations, but said in an emailed statement that the company's technology has helped save thousands of lives around the world. ""Pedophiles and terrorists can freely operate in technological safe-havens, and we provide governments the lawful tools to fight it,"" he wrote. NSO Group has previously said its products are used by government-intelligence and law-enforcement agencies to fight terrorism and crime. The company has also said it has terminated contracts with governments that have abused its software and took steps to prevent abuse. ""Very glad to see Apple join the effort to hold spyware companies accountable,"" Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, said Tuesday in a tweet. ""We've long called for industry action against NSO and today's lawsuit shows that technology providers are united in fighting spyware and ensuring more security for our users."" These two lawsuits show tech giants turning to new methods after years of trying to thwart commercial hacking tools with technical means, said John Scott-Railton, a researcher with Citizen Lab, an organization that has been tracking NSO Group's activities for years. ""Apple has been clearly quietly getting a much better understanding of what's going on with NSO,"" he said. Apple is seeking damages in the lawsuit, and the company said in a statement that it plans to contribute $10 million, plus any damages from the litigation, to organizations pursuing cyber research and advocacy. Firms such as NSO Group ""spend millions of dollars on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability,"" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, said in a witten statement. ""That needs to change."" Apple employees have spent ""thousands of hours"" responding to NSO Group's attacks, Apple said in its filing. NSO Group's tools were used against U.S. citizens, according to Apple's complaint. NSO Group ""did not breach data contained on Apple's servers, but did abuse Apple's services and servers to perpetrate attacks,"" Apple's complaint states. NSO Group software has also allegedly been used on people in countries around the world, including on targets in the U.K., India, South Africa, Belgium, France, Uganda and Morocco, according to Citizen Lab. In 2016, researchers say, NSO Group had discovered a way to install its spyware on victims' iPhones with just the click of a link. In September, researchers said NSO Group developed an even more sophisticated ""zero click"" iPhone attack that installed Pegasus spyware on devices without any action by victims. Both incidents prompted Apple to push out security updates for its devices. NSO Group has faced increasing pressure to change its business practices as researchers have linked its products to cyberattacks on journalists, politicians and political dissidents. On Monday, ratings firm Moody's Corp. downgraded NSO Group's debt, saying the company is at an increased risk of default due to trade restrictions and allegations that its surveillance software has been used inappropriately. NSO Group is ""highly dependent on new license sales which we believe can become increasingly difficult given the actions taken against NSO,"" Moody's said in the report. Earlier this month, the Biden administration placed NSO Group on an export prohibition list to sanction the company for this alleged behavior, restricting it from obtaining some U.S. technology. The move could also make it harder for the company to seek contracts with international customers. The administration said NSO Group ""developed and supplied spyware to foreign governments that used this tool to maliciously target government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics, and embassy workers."" The State Department said the designation, which was also applied to other technology vendors, reflects the administration's goal to halt ""the proliferation and misuse of digital tools used for repression."" 23 Nov 2021 Apple Sues Israeli Firm NSO Over Spyware, Claiming iPhone Hacks By Robert McMillan Apple Inc. has sued the NSO Group, an Israeli maker of surveillance software, alleging the company misused its products and services, escalating the battle over surveillance and user privacy.

""We've long called for industry action against NSO and today's lawsuit shows that technology providers are united in fighting spyware and ensuring more security for our users."" These two lawsuits show tech giants turning to new methods after years of trying to thwart commercial hacking tools with technical means, said John Scott-Railton, a researcher with Citizen Lab, an organization that has been tracking NSO Group's activities for years. ""Apple has been clearly quietly getting a much better understanding of what's going on with NSO,"" he said. Apple is seeking damages in the lawsuit, and the company said in a statement that it plans to contribute $10 million, plus any damages from the litigation, to organizations pursuing cyber research and advocacy. Firms such as NSO Group ""spend millions of dollars on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability,"" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, said in a witten statement. ""That needs to change."" Apple employees have spent ""thousands of hours"" responding to NSO Group's attacks, Apple said in its filing. NSO Group's tools were used against U.S. citizens, according to Apple's complaint. NSO Group ""did not breach data contained on Apple's servers, but did abuse Apple's services and servers to perpetrate attacks,"" Apple's complaint states. NSO Group software has also allegedly been used on people in countries around the world, including on targets in the U.K., India, South Africa, Belgium, France, Uganda and Morocco, according to Citizen Lab. In 2016, researchers say, NSO Group had discovered a way to install its spyware on victims' iPhones with just the click of a link. In September, researchers said NSO Group developed an even more sophisticated ""zero click"" iPhone attack that installed Pegasus spyware on devices without any action by victims. Both incidents prompted Apple to push out security updates for its devices. NSO Group has faced increasing pressure to change its business practices as researchers have linked its products to cyberattacks on journalists, politicians and political dissidents. On Monday, ratings firm Moody's Corp. downgraded NSO Group's debt, saying the company is at an increased risk of default due to trade restrictions and allegations that its surveillance software has been used inappropriately. NSO Group is ""highly dependent on new license sales which we believe can become increasingly difficult given the actions taken against NSO,"" Moody's said in the report. Earlier this month, the Biden administration placed NSO Group on an export prohibition list to sanction the company for this alleged behavior, restricting it from obtaining some U.S. technology. The move could also make it harder for the company to seek contracts with international customers. The administration said NSO Group ""developed and supplied spyware to foreign governments that used this tool to maliciously target government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics, and embassy workers."" The State Department said the designation, which was also applied to other technology vendors, reflects the administration's goal to halt ""the proliferation and misuse of digital tools used for repression.""

Apple,Apple Event: New Mac Computers Expected With In-House Processing Power,10 November 2020,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,979 words",0.9918,0.091,0.016,0.893,"English , Inc. While excitement for Apple Inc.'s new iPhones has helped boost the company's share price to record highs, a nearly 40-year-old workhorse with stagnating sales in recent years is notching impressive growth: the Mac. Sales of the computer line rose 29% in the past quarter to a record $9 billion. Apple has seen huge interest in many of its products, from iPads to headphones, as students and workers stay home because of the coronavirus pandemic. At 1 p.m. EST, the Mac lineup is going to get its biggest jolt in years, with the expected introduction of laptops with Apple's own microchips, technology that is supposed to give the devices faster performance, better battery life and, maybe, bigger profits. The event will be streamed from Apple's website. The success has garnered new excitement from investors, such as Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager who focuses on technology at Synovus Trust Co., which counts Apple among its largest holdings. ""A product that was once considered a dinosaur in the Apple product lineup has gained new traction after the pandemic hit with the work-from-home movement,"" Mr. Morgan said. After years of flat sales, ""the Mac has become an important growth driver."" The arrival of the new devices will mark a breakup in Apple's 15-year relationship with Intel Corp., which Apple co-founder Steve Jobs tapped in 2005 to improve performance in Apple computers, then the company's primary business. It is also the latest example of tech companies developing their own computing power. Chief Executive Tim Cook announced the shift in June, saying the company would begin jettisoning Intel processors over the course of two years beginning by year-end. The chips are based on Arm Holdings technology, designed to improve battery life, speed and security, the company said at the time. The change is in line with Mr. Cook's broader effort to bring more in-house designed components, following similar steps taken with the iPhone that allow the company to cut costs and bring special features to its products, such as image processing through machine-learning algorithms on the smartphones. Custom Apple chips should allow the company to save $150 to $200 per computer, Mark Vena, an analyst for Moor Insights & Strategy, said. That savings could help fund more features in the new computers or boost profitability, he said. Apple has sought to help software developers prepare for the switch, because the new computers will have a different central processing unit, which speaks a different language than existing Macs. Software chief Craig Federighi has said the company would continue to support and release new versions of its operating software for Intel-based Macs for years to come. The company's shift to its own chip design comes as the Mac business has seen renewed life in the past nine months. Megan Behringer, an academic in Tennessee, said she purchased a new MacBook Pro recently because she enjoys seamlessly moving from one device to another to do her work. She said she was attracted to the laptop, in part, because of the Apple ecosystem that lets her easily move among different devices. ""Being able to drop a protocol or a journal article onto my iPad and then walk into the lab with it, or image something in the lab with the iPhone/iPad and then drop it on to the MacBook to analyze it, is incredibly convenient,"" said Ms. Behringer, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University. The Mac's success, however, isn't just among returning customers. Mr. Cook told analysts in July that almost 50% of the customers were new. In China, it was three out of four buyers. Apple completed its most recent fiscal year in September with Mac revenue rising 11% to $28.6 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet, on average, predict sales would rise 4.5% this year. Apple turned to Intel in 2005 to help bolster its computers against more powerful rivals. Helped by popular designs such as the MacBook in 2006 and the halo effect of the iPhone, its share of global computers sales rose to 7.3% in 2017 before slipping to 6.6% in 2019, according to IDC. In recent years, the MacBook has been plagued with complaints about its so-called butterfly keyboard -- which were addressed in the past year. The new growth comes as Apple has focused on growing its services business to augment falling iPhone sales. Investors are betting that the arrival in recent weeks of the iPhone 12, with the ability to connect to faster 5G cellular networks, will spark new interest in the device and possibly rival past records. But in the quarter that ended in September, sales of the old iPhones fell 21% compared with a year earlier, worse than analysts had expected. Yet Apple beat Wall Street's overall sales expectations, in part, because of robust Mac sales. In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said he believed the Mac lineup could continue to see upbeat results in the new fiscal year. ""The demand continues to be very strong,"" he said. 10 Nov 2020 Apple Event: New Mac Computers Expected With In-House Processing Power By Tim Higgins While excitement for Apple Inc.'s new iPhones has helped boost the company's share price to record highs, a nearly 40-year-old workhorse with stagnating sales in recent years is notching impressive growth: the Mac. Sales of the computer line rose 29% in the past quarter to a record $9 billion. Apple has seen huge interest in many of its products, from iPads to headphones, as students and workers stay home because of the coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, the Mac lineup got its biggest jolt in years during a virtual event streamed online and filmed at the company's Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. Apple introduced a new M1 microchip that's supposed to give devices faster performance, better battery life and, maybe, bigger profits. The new chip will go first into a new, super-thin MacBook Air laptop, starting at $999, a 13-inch MacBook Pro, starting at $1,299, and the Mac Mini computer, starting at $699. Among the accolades listed during the Apple presentation, the company said the new chip would allow the MacBook Air to be 3.5 times faster than the previous generation and run silently because it wouldn't need a fan to keep it cool. ""Advancements of this magnitude only come from making bold changes,"" Chief Executive Tim Cook said Tuesday. ""The M1 chip is by far the most powerful chip that we have ever created."" It marked the third virtual event held since September without a live, in-auditorium audience because of efforts to fight the coronavirus. The success of the Mac lineup garnered new excitement from investors, such as Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager who focuses on technology at Synovus Trust Co., which counts Apple among its largest holdings.

Apple,Technology,28 April 2021,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,118 words",0.9826,0.084,0.046,0.871,"Corrections & Amplifications Eric Seufert's name was incorrectly rendered as E in an earlier version of this article. (Corrected on Jan. 14) Under Apple Inc.'s new privacy restrictions, advertisers targeting iPhone users will get more data about ad performance if they buy Apple's ad space than if they buy through third parties, according to ad-industry executives. The difference could eventually give Apple's small but growing ad business an edge over rivals, ad executives and app makers say. Apple's latest operating system for iPhones has set off a firestorm in the ad industry and beyond by letting users decide whether to let apps track them for advertising purposes—changes that mean companies may soon have less data about who sees their ads. Apps on Apple's iOS platform must ask users' permission to track them for advertising purposes . When targeting users who have opted out of tracking, advertisers who buy ads through third-party platforms will have to wait three days for insights on their campaigns and will receive only aggregate information, such as the total number of users who took an action after an ad, people familiar with Apple's ad products said. Advertisers who buy Apple ad space can receive more data about user behavior, the people said. They can learn which version of their ads users saw and which search keywords ads appeared on, they said. Those advertisers will get results nearly in real time, the people said. That could give Apple an edge in luring advertisers, especially if the tech company expands its ad business, ad-industry executives say. Right now, Apple sells search ads that appear in its App Store and display ads that appear in its News and Stocks apps. An Apple spokesman denied that the company is advantaging its own products and said the data restrictions for ads bought on third-party platforms are needed because some advertisers could use that information to circumvent Apple's privacy rules and track individual users. Apple's own ad products can't be exploited in the same way, the company said, because advertisers on its platforms can only target large groups of people. Apple's advertising business consists primarily of search ads on its app store, which won't be affected by the coming privacy restrictions. Those ad placements mostly appeal to a relatively small subset of advertisers: app makers, which can bid to appear atop search results. Apple's app-store advertising is expected to bring in about $2 billion this fiscal year, according to an estimate from Cowen & Co. Last fiscal year, Apple's total revenue was $274.52 billion. By comparison, Facebook Inc. reported $84.17 billion in ad revenue last year. Apple is planning to expand its ad offerings and is testing a new ad slot that will be available in the App Store's ""suggested"" category, which could be targeted based on users' interest and audience data, the people familiar with Apple's ad products said. The Financial Times earlier reported on Apple's planned ad slot. Even without more ad space to sell, Apple could fetch higher ad prices if demand for its ad space rises as a result of the privacy changes, ad executives said. Eric Seufert, an analyst and marketing-strategy consultant, criticized Apple's plan, saying detailed data on ads' performance is valuable to marketers. ""So it's not really clear why they would withhold it from"" advertisers buying through other ad sellers, he said, ""unless they were just really trying to privilege their own ad networks."" Digital Ads and Privacy * Apple Scores Legal Win in France Over App-Privacy Changes * T-Mobile to Step Up Ad Targeting of Cellphone Customers * Google's User-Tracking Crackdown Has Advertisers Bracing for Change * Google Crushed Many Digital Ad Rivals. But a Challenger Is Rising. Apple said the technologies behind its new privacy restrictions are ""designed to help developers implement safe advertising practices and protect users—not to advantage Apple."" Facebook, app publishers and ad-tech companies have also criticized the changes. In March, France's competition regulator rejected advertisers' push to halt Apple's software update. The regulator is reviewing whether Apple applied less stringent data-use rules to itself than to other services, and has promised a final ruling by early next year. Apple said it was looking forward to further engagement with France's competition regulator on the matter. ""We firmly believe that users' data belongs to them, and that they should control when that data is shared, and with whom,"" the company said. Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, said critics will struggle to argue that Apple's privacy rules violate antitrust laws, since the company says it is motivated by privacy concerns and offers users a choice of whether or not to accept tracking. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services. Ad executives say Apple could become a big player in the $400 billion global digital-ad industry. The company has gone down that road before. It bid in 2009 on AdMob Inc., a specialist in brokering ad sales on mobile phones , but was beat out by Google. Apple in 2010 launched its own ad network, iAd, which facilitated ad sales in iPhone apps . The business failed to catch on, and Apple shut it in 2016. ""Apple basically almost recused themselves from the advertising ecosystem a number of years ago because it was too small, and they had a perception that it was going to damage the brand of their hardware business,"" said Chad Engelgau, chief executive officer of Acxiom, the data unit owned by ad-agency holding company Interpublic Group of Cos. ""They are absolutely investing in the advertising business going forward,"" he said. ""They have a level of control, being a hardware manufacturer, being a content provider."" In 2018 Apple sought to expand its digital-advertising business , and met with major apps including Snap Inc. and Pinterest Inc. about participating in an Apple network that would distribute ads across a network of participating apps. Competing with Google and Facebook on ads that appear in mobile-phone apps wouldn't be easy. Google and Facebook dominated, in part, because of their detailed data on users. Apple has criticized extensive use of data for advertising.

Apple,Apple's App Store Under Fire in Supreme Court Case,26 November 2018,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,507 words",-0.9101,0.086,0.103,0.811,"English , Inc. WASHINGTON -- Apple Inc.'s exclusive market for selling iPhone apps came under fire at the Supreme Court Monday, as justices considered whether consumers should be allowed to proceed with a lawsuit alleging the company has an illegal monopoly that produces higher prices. The plaintiffs are a group of consumers pursuing a class-action lawsuit seeking damages on behalf of people who have purchased iPhone apps. They argue that prices are higher than they would be in a competitive market because Apple requires that all software for its phones be sold and purchased through its App Store. App developers can only reach iPhone users through Apple's store, and the company charges the developers a 30% commission. The case came to the high court Monday on the indirect but critical question of who has the legal right to sue over Apple's alleged monopoly. The iPhone maker argues that consumers can't sue because the company doesn't directly set app prices, a responsibility that lies with the app developers. Apple says it only serves as a conduit, and consumers aren't really buying apps from the company. If anyone can sue over the alleged monopoly, Apple's lawyers suggest, it would be the app developers themselves, since they're the ones buying directly from the company when they pay Apple to feature their software in its App store. The justices, and the court system more broadly, have regularly wrestled in recent years over how old laws should interact with new technology, sometimes raising the question of whether current law is adequate to address a rapidly evolving technological landscape. In this case, it was clear the justices had at least some familiarity with the issue through their own iPhones. The court's four liberal justices pushed back against Apple's position during the hourlong oral argument. Justice Elena Kagan, among others, said that when she buys an app on an iPhone, she is engaging in a transaction directly with Apple. ""Here the person is transacting with the monopolist itself,"" she said. Some conservative justices also questioned Apple's position, although at times for different reasons. Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch questioned the propriety of a Supreme Court precedent from 1977 -- relied upon heavily by Apple -- that limits claims for antitrust damages to immediate victims of the anticompetitive conduct. That case prohibits a purchaser from suing someone a few links earlier in the supply chain simply because higher prices were eventually passed on to them. Under Apple's theory, Justice Alito noted, only the app developers themselves could sue, and he asked whether any had done so. No, said the lawyer representing Apple, Daniel Wall. But he noted that government antitrust authorities haven't challenged Apple either, suggesting the lack of legal action could reflect the absence of any anti-competitive behavior on Apple's part. Chief Justice John Roberts spoke most sympathetically of Apple's position, saying the idea behind the 1977 ruling was to prevent companies from facing lawsuits from different groups of plaintiffs over the same behavior. The Supreme Court hasn't explicitly said it would consider overruling past precedent in the case -- which it generally does when that is a possibility -- so it's not clear how Monday's discussion will factor into the outcome. A federal appeals court previously allowed the lawsuit against Apple to proceed, and the Supreme Court is considering that ruling. A decision is expected by the end of June. 26 Nov 2018 Apple's App Store Under Fire in Supreme Court Case - Update By Brent Kendall WASHINGTON -- Apple Inc.'s exclusive market for selling iPhone apps came under fire at the Supreme Court Monday, as justices considered whether consumers should be allowed to proceed with a lawsuit alleging the company has an illegal monopoly that produces higher prices. The plaintiffs are a group of consumers challenging Apple's requirement that all software for its phones be sold and purchased through its App Store. Their class action lawsuit seeks damages on behalf of people who have purchased iPhone apps. App developers can only reach iPhone users through Apple's store, and the company charges the developers a 30% commission. ""Apple directed anti-competitive restraints at iPhone owners to prevent them from buying apps anywhere other than Apple's monopoly App Store,"" plaintiffs' lawyer David Frederick told the court during an hour-long oral argument. ""As a result, iPhone owners paid Apple more for apps than they would have paid in a competitive retail market."" The case comes to the court on the preliminary but critical question of who has the legal right to sue over Apple's alleged monopoly. If the justices allow the lawsuit to proceed, the case has the potential to force changes to how apps are sold, and it could expose Apple to a significant monetary judgment if the company is found to have violated antitrust laws. The iPhone maker argues that consumers can't sue because the company doesn't directly set app prices, a responsibility that lies with the app developers. Apple says it only serves as a conduit, and consumers aren't really buying apps from the company. If anyone can sue over the alleged monopoly, Apple says, it would be the app developers themselves, since they're the ones paying to feature their software in its App Store. The developers ""are buying a package of services, which include distribution and software and intellectual property and testing,"" lawyer Daniel M. Wall, representing Apple, told the court. Apple in a statement said it provides ""a safe, secure and trusted storefront for customers"" that has fueled app growth, ""leading to millions of jobs in the new app economy and facilitating more than $100 billion in payments to developers worldwide."" The justices at times proceed cautiously with discussions about modern technology, but in this case it was clear they had familiarity -- and personal experience -- with the issue. ""I pick up my iPhone. I go to Apple's App Store. I pay Apple directly with the credit card information that I've supplied to Apple. From my perspective, I've just engaged in a one-step transaction with Apple,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. She suggested that kind of direct commercial relationship with the company was enough to give consumers a right to sue. The court's other three liberal justices voiced similar views. Some conservative justices also questioned Apple's position, although at times for different reasons. Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch questioned the propriety of a Supreme Court precedent from 1977 -- relied upon heavily by Apple -- that under federal law limits claims for antitrust damages to immediate victims of the anticompetitive conduct. That case prohibits a purchaser from suing someone a few links earlier in the supply chain simply because higher prices were eventually passed on to them. Justices Alito and Gorsuch, however, suggested that 40 years of economic evidence has undermined the logic of the court's earlier ruling. ""I really wonder whether, in light of what has happened since then, the court's evaluation stands up,"" Justice Alito said. He asked whether any of the tens of thousand of app developers had ever sued Apple. No, said Mr. Wall. He noted that ""no state or federal antitrust agency has ever sued either,"" suggesting the lack of legal action could reflect the absence of any anticompetitive behavior on Apple's part. The Supreme Court hasn't explicitly said it would consider overruling past precedent in the case -- which it generally does when that is a possibility -- so it's not clear how Monday's discussion will factor into the outcome. A federal appeals court previously allowed the lawsuit against Apple to proceed, and the Supreme Court is considering that ruling. Chief Justice John Roberts spoke most sympathetically of Apple's position, echoing the concern behind the 1977 ruling that companies could face dueling lawsuits and duplicative financial damages from different groups of plaintiffs over the same behavior. Apple's app distribution system for iPhones is different from what consumers use for phones issued by an array of companies that operate on the Android system developed by Alphabet Inc.'s Google. In addition to Google Play, the leading Android app store in the U.S., there are a number of smaller stores, including those provided by Amazon.com Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Developers such as Epic Games Inc., the maker of Fortnite, also have gone direct to consumers using Android. Apple's iOS operating system has a 40% market share in the U.S. compared with Android's 60% share, according to Kantar Worldpanel, a market research firm. The Supreme Court's decision is expected by the end of June. --Tripp Mickle contributed to this article. (END) Dow Jones Newswires November 26, 2018 (22:33 GMT)"
Apple,Epic Games Faces Apple in Final Day of Courtroom Battle Over Monopoly Claims -- Update,24 May 2021,Dow Jones Institutional News,"2,089 words",0.4555,0.045,0.042,0.913,"English , Inc. Lawyers for Apple Inc. and Epic Games Inc. on Monday began making their final arguments to a judge deciding whether the iPhone maker has an unfair monopoly that hurts third-party software developers. They began debating a familiar topic: how to define the market at the center of the case. Epic would like U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to consider the distribution of apps on iPhones as the market while Apple emphasized that there are many competing devices. ""The issue here is the monopoly that they have on the distribution of apps onto that platform,"" Gary Bornstein, an Epic lawyer, said. ""There is no path onto that platform, other than the one that they control that has led to decreased innovation and higher prices."" Judge Gonzalez Rogers will rule on Epic's claim that Apple has improperly prohibited third-party app stores on the iPhone and required app developers to use its in-app payment system that takes a commission of as much as 30%. Apple has denied it is a monopoly, pointing to other ways Epic's game ""Fortnite"" can be distributed. The company has said its rules around the app store ensure the safety and reliability of apps for users. Apple has argued its fees are similar to others and that Epic is merely trying to get out of paying its fair share. Instead of traditional closing arguments held before a jury, the judge had asked the two sides to prepare for a debate-style end to the trial that has lasted more than three weeks in Oakland, Calif. She began immediately probing their arguments, suggesting that Epic's view of the market and its substitutes could hurt consumers because they pick a particular digital ecosystem, such as Apple's iOS operating system, knowing they are walled gardens. ""Your economic substitutes destroy that consumer choice,"" she said. Furthermore, she questioned why the market shouldn't be defined as mobile games. Before Monday, the judge gave each side a list of topics she wanted to hear more about and instructed them to be prepared to talk about potential remedies. She has already raised the idea of letting app developers provide a link or inform users in the app that they could leave to find cheaper ways to pay for purchases outside of the Apple system -- something currently prohibited under the company's App Store rules. ""I will let you all drive the conversation,"" Judge Gonzalez Rogers told the lawyers on Friday. ""I will push you faster through topics which are of less concern, and I will spend more time with you on things that are, you know, that I'm debating right now."" The judge hasn't been shy in chiming in during the proceedings with questions of her own for witnesses, including directly probing the chief executives of both Epic and Apple, Tim Sweeney and Tim Cook, respectively. Her sharp questions to Mr. Cook on Friday surprised some close observers along with her statements that suggested she finds parts of Apple's business uncompetitive, such as its in-app payment system. That doesn't mean she has made up her mind. She has told the lawyers she wants to hear more on the matter. On Monday, Apple defended its 30% commission. ""That commission rate wasn't created by Steve Jobs,"" Dan Swanson, an Apple lawyer, said of the company's late co-founder. The price came from what was found on a digital videogame distribution platform called Steam and was cheaper than what was found in physical stores at the time, Mr. Swanson said. Mr. Bornstein, Epic's lawyer, responded that there was no evidence that Apple felt pressure on pricing from competition. ""This is a dynamic market,"" Judge Gonzalez Rogers said. ""Things are changing rapidly. I have a snapshot. We are at a point in time in a moving stream so understanding what your perspective would be for the court's role in that dynamic environment, that would be interesting to me."" The judge has said it would take her several weeks to render a verdict, joking that she hoped it could be done before Aug. 13 -- the first anniversary of Epic launching a sophisticated campaign to challenge Apple's power that landed both sides in her courtroom this month. On that date a year ago, Epic introduced an in-app payment system in ""Fortnite"" aimed at circumventing Apple's system and violating its rules. The game was quickly kicked out of the app store and, in turn, Epic filed its lawsuit against Apple. The case centers around themes of online platforms and digital commerce that are being hotly debated by lawmakers and regulators around the world. A loss by Apple threatens a key part of Mr. Cook's strategy for diversifying the company's business after seeing the stagnation of iPhone sales in recent years. But winning an antitrust case in the U.S. has traditionally proven hard for plaintiffs; courts in recent years have given more latitude to company practices through a more narrow reading of antitrust laws. Epic has to convince the judge its market definition is correct. It also has to show that Apple's policies cause antitrust harm and that the practices don't benefit the consumer. Apple has spent a lot of time justifying its prohibition of third-party stores by arguing it protects users and pointing to its app review process as helping ensure security and reliability. Epic has countered that the security concerns are overblown, arguing a third-party store could provide equal protection and that the safety of the iPhone is rooted in its operating system. Both sides have presented conflicting testimony on the security of the iPhone. During Friday's proceedings, the judge turned to Mr. Cook and asked him about it directly. ""Mr. Cook, what do you think the third-party data shows?"" she asked. ""You personally, the difference."" He told the judge that the data shows 1% to 2% of malware is on iPhones. ""It's quite a difference,"" he said. 24 May 2021 Epic Games Faces Apple in Final Day of Courtroom Battle Over Monopoly Claims By Tim Higgins Lawyers for Apple Inc. and Epic Games Inc. on Monday began making their final arguments to a judge deciding whether the iPhone maker has an unfair monopoly that hurts third-party software developers. They began debating a familiar topic: how to define the market at the center of the case. Epic would like U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to consider the distribution of apps on iPhones as the market while Apple emphasized that there are many competing devices. ""The issue here is the monopoly that they have on the distribution of apps onto that platform,"" Gary Bornstein, an Epic lawyer, said. ""There is no path onto that platform, other than the one that they control that has led to decreased innovation and higher prices."" Judge Gonzalez Rogers will rule on Epic's claim that Apple has improperly prohibited third-party app stores on the iPhone and required app developers to use its in-app payment system that takes a commission of as much as 30%. Apple has denied it is a monopoly, pointing to other ways Epic's game ""Fortnite"" can be distributed. The company has said its rules around the app store ensure the safety and reliability of apps for users. Apple has argued its fees are similar to others and that Epic is merely trying to get out of paying its fair share. Instead of traditional closing arguments held before a jury, the judge had asked the two sides to prepare for a debate-style end to the trial that has lasted more than three weeks in Oakland, Calif. She began immediately probing their arguments, suggesting that Epic's view of the market and its substitutes could hurt consumers because they pick a particular digital ecosystem, such as Apple's iOS operating system, knowing they are walled gardens. ""Your economic substitutes destroy that consumer choice,"" she said. Furthermore, she questioned why the market shouldn't be defined as mobile games. Before Monday, the judge gave each side a list of topics she wanted to hear more about and instructed them to be prepared to talk about potential remedies. She has already raised the idea of letting app developers provide a link or inform users in the app that they could leave to find cheaper ways to pay for purchases outside of the Apple system -- something currently prohibited under the company's App Store rules. ""I will let you all drive the conversation,"" Judge Gonzalez Rogers told the lawyers on Friday. ""I will push you faster through topics which are of less concern, and I will spend more time with you on things that are, you know, that I'm debating right now."" The judge hasn't been shy in chiming in during the proceedings with questions of her own for witnesses, including directly probing the chief executives of both Epic and Apple, Tim Sweeney and Tim Cook, respectively. Her sharp questions to Mr. Cook on Friday surprised some close observers along with her statements that suggested she finds parts of Apple's business uncompetitive, such as its in-app payment system. That doesn't mean she has made up her mind. She has told the lawyers she wants to hear more on the matter. On Monday, Apple defended its 30% commission. ""That commission rate wasn't created by Steve Jobs,"" Dan Swanson, an Apple lawyer, said of the company's late co-founder. The price came from what was found on a digital videogame distribution platform called Steam and was cheaper than what was found in physical stores at the time, Mr. Swanson said. Mr. Bornstein, Epic's lawyer, responded that there was no evidence that Apple felt pressure on pricing from competition. ""This is a dynamic market,"" Judge Gonzalez Rogers said. ""Things are changing rapidly. I have a snapshot. We are at a point in time in a moving stream so understanding what your perspective would be for the court's role in that dynamic environment, that would be interesting to me."" The judge has said it would take her several weeks to render a verdict, joking that she hoped it could be done before Aug. 13 -- the first anniversary of Epic launching a sophisticated campaign to challenge Apple's power that landed both sides in her courtroom this month. On that date a year ago, Epic introduced an in-app payment system in ""Fortnite"" aimed at circumventing Apple's system and violating its rules. The game was quickly kicked out of the app store and, in turn, Epic filed its lawsuit against Apple. The case centers around themes of online platforms and digital commerce that are being hotly debated by lawmakers and regulators around the world. A loss by Apple threatens a key part of Mr. Cook's strategy for diversifying the company's business after seeing the stagnation of iPhone sales in recent years. But winning an antitrust case in the U.S. has traditionally proven hard for plaintiffs; courts in recent years have given more latitude to company practices through a more narrow reading of antitrust laws. Epic has to convince the judge its market definition is correct. It also has to show that Apple's policies cause antitrust harm and that the practices don't benefit the consumer. Apple has spent a lot of time justifying its prohibition of third-party stores by arguing it protects users and pointing to its app review process as helping ensure security and reliability. Epic has countered that the security concerns are overblown, arguing a third-party store could provide equal protection and that the safety of the iPhone is rooted in its operating system. Both sides have presented conflicting testimony on the security of the iPhone. During Friday's proceedings, the judge turned to Mr. Cook and asked him about it directly. ""Mr. Cook, what do you think the third-party data shows?"" she asked. ""You personally, the difference."" He told the judge that the data shows 1% to 2% of malware is on iPhones. ""It's quite a difference,"" he said. (END) Dow Jones Newswires May 24, 2021 (17:39 GMT)"

Apple,Everybody vs. the App Store: Why Companies Are Taking Issue With Apple’s Growing Revenue Engine,28 September 2020,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,189 words",-0.882,0.059,0.07,0.871,"English , Inc. A host of companies, including FacebookInc., Spotify TechnologySA and “Fortnite” maker Epic Games Inc., are challenging the way AppleInc. runs its App Store. The App Store generates at least $15 billion in annual sales for the tech giant, according to analysts’ estimates. Critics say Apple takes too big a cut of app makers’ sales and wields monopoly power over the gateway that connects hundreds of millions of users to mobile apps. Apple disputes that characterization, saying that it collects only a portion of sales from a small percentage of the almost 2 million apps available on the App Store and that its practices are in line with competitors’ app marketplaces. Here is an overview of recent challenges to the App Store model and what they mean for consumers and the company. Fee skirmishes Apple takes a 30% cut on sales of paid apps and digital goods sold within apps. Numerous companies have complained that the fee is excessive and are pressing Apple to allow alternate payment systems to process digital transactions. Apple’s fee is in line with those charged in Google’s Google Play store and Samsung Electronics Co.’s Samsung Galaxy Store. Apple said the commission helps cover overhead costs such as security and privacy. Last month, Epic Games attempted to skirt Apple’s commission by adding its own payment system to the version of “Fortnite” played on iPhones and iPads. Apple quickly removed the shooter-survival game from the App Store, saying Epic violated its rules. The two companies are now suing each other over the matter, with Epic claiming “Fortnite” should be allowed back into the App Store with its payment system intact and Apple saying Epic should be restricted from engaging in what it calls unfair business practices. A judge ruled last month that Apple can keep “Fortnite” out of the App Store for now, but the company can’t block Epic’s access to developer tools used to update software. A court hearing in the case is scheduled for Monday. A trial is likely to take place next year. Who pays Apple’s 30% commission on digital goods and services means that a customer’s payments to Epic for “Fortnite” weapons are subject to the fee, but purchases of coffee in Starbucks Corp.’s mobile app aren’t. For subscriptions purchased via the App Store, Apple’s cut falls to 15% after the first year. Apple also collects an annual fee from developers who submit software to be distributed via the App Store, with exceptions for nonprofits and government entities. To sidestep Apple’s cut, NetflixInc., Spotify and other companies have shifted to selling subscriptions and downloads via their websites instead of their apps. Apple bars companies from mentioning in their apps where consumers can go to subscribe, and it doesn’t allow companies to say they are offering higher prices in app purchases to offset Apple’s fee. Companies switching from selling real-world goods to digital ones amid the pandemic—such as Airbnb Inc., which now sells travelers virtual experiences such as cooking classes—have complained that Apple wanted a cut of those sales. Competition Some app developerssay Apple limits competitionand ranks its own products ahead of rivals’ products in App Store search results. Spotify filed an antitrust complaint in Europe last year claiming that Apple, whose Apple Music service competes with Spotify, made it difficult for rival services to market themselves in the App Store. The music-streaming company this month accused Apple in public statements of unfairly harming competitors after the tech giant unveiled a new bundle giving users access to multiple Apple services, including Music, at a discounted price. A spokeswoman for Spotify said the company is concerned that Apple is using its market power and app marketplace to advantage its own products. Appledefended its new bundle, saying it would recommend a plan to customers “that saves you the most money based on the subscriptions you already have.” MicrosoftCorp., Facebook, Tinder owner Match Group Inc. and Audiobooks.com also have publicly complained about Apple’s practices or described the company as monopolistic. Apple has repeatedlysaid it doesn’t give its own products an advantage. Congress, the Justice Department, the European Union and the Federal Trade Commission are investigating Apple and other tech companies on antitrust grounds. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that consumers can sue Apple for forcing them to buy apps exclusively from the tech giant. The ruling didn’t address plaintiffs’ claims that apps would be cheaper if software developers could sell them directly and bypass Apple. A lawsuit filed last yearby developers over App Store practices is ongoing in California federal court. Does anyone win against Apple? It helps to be a big name when going up against one of the world’s largest companies. In 2015, Taylor Swift complained that three-month trial subscriptions to Apple Music meant artists went unpaid when users streamed their music through the service. Apple later changed the policy and pays artists for music streamed via trial memberships. Amazon.com Inc. successfully pushed back against the App Store commission, in 2016 striking a deal that sets a 15% commission on subscription sales to Amazon Prime Video and not the 30% fee that all other apps are required to pay on first-year digital-subscription sales. In April, Amazon began using its own payment system to fulfill Prime Video purchases through its app with Apple’s blessing. Apple has said that is because Amazon is in a program for “premium subscription video entertainment providers,” which permits members to use the payment method tied to customers’ existing video subscriptions. In August, a trade body representing the New York Times, the Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and other publishers saidthe outlets want better deal terms from Apple on their digital-subscription sales. Apple on Friday said it is cutting its commission on some paid events and experiences sold through mobile apps through the end of 2020. A company spokesman said the move is a recognition that some businesses have had to switch to online experiences as the pandemic halted many in-person gatherings and events. Apple’s next moves Apple has faced plenty of disputes since its inception in a Los Altos, Calif., garage 44 years ago, and rarely gives up ground to opponents. But where adversaries in years past complained about things including Apple’s iTunes music service and e-book pricing, companies today are targeting a source of revenue that Chief Executive Tim Cook has put at the heart of the tech giant’s future. Some software developers formed a nonprofit to press for changes to app marketplaces. It is unclear whether decisions from courts or regulators will prompt Apple to adjust its rules or whether the company will try to hold firm in the face of pushback. and Sarah E.

Apple,"Overlap of Tech Earnings, Trade Talks, Fed Meeting Will Test Stocks",27 January 2019,Dow Jones Institutional News,835 words,0.9743,0.078,0.023,0.9,"English , Inc. A rebound in shares of beaten-down technology companies has helped steady the stock market following its worst quarter since 2011. Their latest earnings results could dictate whether that momentum continues or market volatility picks back up. Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are among the large internet and software companies reporting fourth-quarter numbers this week. The figures will offer clues for investors waiting to see whether the sector can resume its role powering the stock market higher with robust sales growth. Also reporting are other closely watched Silicon Valley firms including Facebook Inc., Tesla Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., as well as a number of industrial, consumer products and energy companies. The rare confluence of those results with a Federal Reserve meeting, monthly jobs report and scheduled trade talks in Washington between the U.S. and China could upend the recent stretch of quiet trading in financial markets. Because Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are three of the four largest public companies in the world, some investors view their results as a barometer for economic activity and consumer spending. All three companies spooked investors in October when they reported slowing growth among their leading products or services. Apple's results, in particular, will be scrutinized heavily late Tuesday after a rare cut to its quarterly revenue forecast sent stocks tumbling Jan. 3. The iPhone maker cited slowing economic growth in China as a main culprit for the move, which came amid longstanding investor fears that plateauing revenue from the company's flagship product could hurt shares. After Apple's warning, Wall Street analysts expect the company to report a 14% drop in quarterly iPhone sales from a year earlier, targeting nearly $53 billion in iPhone revenue. While many other technology stocks have rebounded in January, Apple shares are up less than 0.1% in 2019. The stock, off 28% over the past three months, now looks cheap based on common metrics, trading at 13.3 times earnings in the past year, compared with 18.4 for the S&P 500, 44 for Microsoft and 94 for Amazon, according to FactSet. Microsoft, now the world's largest public company following Apple's recent swoon and a pullback in Amazon shares, will report results after the market closes Wednesday, a few hours after the Fed releases its latest policy statement. Analysts project steady growth from its intelligent cloud segment, which includes server products and its Azure cloud-computing business. Quarterly revenue in that category is expected to increase nearly 20% from a year earlier, compared with overall sales growth of about 13%. Amazon's report for the holiday quarter is again expected to show steady revenue growth in its core retail and cloud-computing businesses. The figures, on tap for Thursday afternoon, are projected to show a nearly 20% rise in overall sales from a year earlier and 42% surge in revenue from Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing arm some analysts expect to set the e-commerce company apart in the coming years. The Seattle-based company is projected to eclipse $2.5 billion in profit for the third consecutive quarter. Amazon's market value was recently $817 billion, compared with $823 billion for Microsoft and $746 billion for Apple. Amazon and Apple became the first U.S. companies to reach $1 trillion in market capitalization last summer. Google parent Alphabet Inc., valued at about $762 billion, is scheduled to report earnings Feb. 4 and will be the last of the so-called FAANG stocks -- Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix Inc. and Alphabet -- to post results. Netflix, which kicked off earnings season for the group, has seen its shares fall 4.3% since forecasting slower revenue growth Jan. 17, though the stock is still up 26% for the year. Facebook, meanwhile, is scheduled to report Wednesday. Its shares are up 14% for 2019 but still down 31% over the past six months. With investors still weighing concerns about slowing global growth amid trade tensions, commentary from a number of industrial companies including Boeing Co., 3M Co., Whirlpool Corp. and Harley-Davidson Inc. will also be in focus this week. Investors will be watching to see whether they echo Apple's warning about China. Caterpillar Inc. and 3M both said in October that U.S. tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum were increasing their costs. Other big names on deck are McDonald's Corp., Verizon Communications Inc., private-equity firms such as Blackstone Group L.P. and oil-and-gas producers Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. Friday's numbers from Exxon and Chevron will coincide with this month's jobs report. Stronger-than-expected jobs growth in December and comments from Fed officials indicating they will be patient in raising interest rates have buoyed stocks to start January.

Privacy experts expect Apple to use artificial intelligence to analyze apps that collect data and have staff audit apps that are suspected of violations. Should those efforts fall short, Apple could later block app developers from uploading iPhone address books to servers, said Domingo Guerra , president of Appthority, a mobile security company. Instead, he said Apple could require apps to use the contact list locally on the device, eliminating any data risk. (tripp.mickle@wsj.com) Apple 's new privacy rules should help the company avoid a future crisis as it moves to put health data on iPhones. The company, which added medical records to iPhones earlier this year, faced the risk that apps or VPNs could gain access to that data unless it tightened its guidelines for developers, said Pam Dixon of the World Privacy Forum. She added, ""Apple needs to clamp this down. They've done the right thing."" (tripp.mickle@wsj.com) Shares of companies that investors believe are vulnerable to tightening trade policies are sliding as a report suggests the Trump administration could levy tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese goods in the coming week.

Investors and analysts have worried that the moves could trigger retaliatory trade measures that crimp profits at US firms. Farm-machinery maker Deere off 2.9%, while Boeing down 1.6% and Caterpillar off 1.7%. Polaris, which relies on steel and aluminum to make off-road vehicles, was down 0.6%. (akane.otani@wsj.com) Apple is trying to enforce new privacy policies across its vast network of iPhone and iPad apps--and in the process is exposing longstanding gaps that left users' data vulnerable to abuse. The company has issued new rules for app developers designed to limit future data collection and ad targeting. The rules thrust Apple into the role of regulator and enforcer in the wake of controversy over the misuse of personal data from Facebook --a scandal that has triggered calls for new federal regulations of digital information. But Apple 's new rules also raise concerns that the company's previous policies contained loopholes allowing apps to collect and resell users' information, including contacts lists and photo locations, privacy advocates say. (tripp.mickle@wsj.com) Apple CEO Tim Cook in March foreshadowed the company's move to lock down privacy rules for App Developers. Cook told MSNBC that he doesn't support regulation but said it was time ""for a set of people to think deeply about what could be done here."" The company's new regulations, out last week, state that apps receiving users' permission to access contact lists and photos can't build databases with that information or sell it to third parties. The company also added rules saying apps need consent when ""recording, logging or making a record of a user's activity,"" and said advertisements inside apps must allow users to see all the information used to target them. (tripp.mickle@wsj.com) Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said at a press conference Wednesday that the economy will be at a point soon where interest rates will be in a zone that is roughly neutral. At that point, it won't be accurate for the Fed to refer in its statement to monetary policy as accommodative. Fed officials have referred to policy as accommodative because rates are still low enough to spur economic activity. (sarah.chaney@wsj.com) Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says the agency has a ""pretty full docket"" of regulatory changes in the works, as it prepares to implement a bill signed by President Trump last month that increased the threshold for a stricter regulatory burden on banks to $250B in assets, from $50B. ""We've got to think about how we will reach below that $250 billion threshold,"" said Powell at a press conference. He added that he wants to tailor post-crisis regulatory reforms for smaller banks. ""We want to keep all that stuff. We want to make it even more effective and certainly more efficient.""

The EEOC alleged in 2017 that certain tests that the railroad operator required job applicants to complete, measuring strength, endurance and aerobic capacity, had a disparate impact on female applicants for jobs such as conductor and material clerk. While such tests are not illegal in all cases, employers must show that it is a business necessity to require job applicants to pass them. The funds from the settlement will be distributed to a class of women in over 20 states who were denied jobs at CSX because of the tests. The company will also change its testing policies and stop using certain tests.

In minutes to the Fed's May meeting, the central bank said a small adjustment to the way the interest on excess reserves rate, or IOER, is set made sense ""sooner rather than later,"" in part because surging Treasury bill and repo rates were forcing the fed-funds rate higher inside the target range.

Apple,Epic Games vs. Apple Trial Prepares for Closing Arguments,23 May 2021,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,366 words",0.9892,0.102,0.06,0.837,"English , Inc. Epic Games Inc.’s courtroom battle against Apple Inc. is expected to end Monday with a debate-style format in which the judge will drill each side with questions about their cases. The trial’s outcome will reverberate far outside the Oakland, Calif., courtroom as Apple faces scrutiny from lawmakers, regulators and software developers who say the company exercises too much control and restricts competition within its App Store. Apple has pushed back against those claims, pointing to the competition it faces from other app stores and devices and the company’s desire to provide a seamless experience for users. The judge is expected to rule in the coming months. During the three-week trial, Epic has argued Apple is improperly blocking third-party app stores on its mobile devices and forcing developers to use its in-app payment system for all digital transactions, allowing it to collect a commission as high as 30%. In response, Apple has said there are many ways for users to access Epic’s “Fortnite” videogame and that its commission is in line with what other platforms take. Apple has argued that Epic is merely trying to take advantage of Apple’s investment and store without paying its fair share. Monday’s final arguments follow Apple’s putting its top executives, including Chief Executive Tim Cook, on the witness stand last week to make the case that the company isn’t a monopoly and that it prohibits third-party app stores to protect users. Below is what we learned last week. Click to see recaps for week one and week two of the trial. Mr. Cook faced pointed questions from U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who suggested Apple’s in-app payment system didn’t face enough competition and noted that game developers bring in a sizable amount of revenue the company collects from the App Store. “I understand this notion that somehow Apple brings the customer to the gamers, the users, but after that first time, after that first interaction…the developers are keeping their customers, Apple is just profiting off that,” she said. Mr. Cook disagreed, arguing that while many of the apps in the store are free to users, their existence helps generate traffic to the store that benefits the game developers. “If we allowed people to link out like that we would in essence give up our total return on” intellectual property, Mr. Cook said. She further asked what problem Apple had with allowing users to have choices, especially the ability to have cheaper options in gaming. “I think they have a choice today,” he responded. “They have a choice between many different Android models of a smartphone, or an iPhone, and that iPhone has a certain set of principles behind it in safety, security and privacy.” Epic has argued that Apple’s claim that it must tightly control its App Store for security reasons is overblown and is an attempt to justify keeping third-party app stores off the iPhone. To help make the case, Epic has relied on testimony that says the operating system is the key to the phone’s security and suggested a system similar to Apple’s laptops and desktops would be equally secure. Apple’s top software executive, Craig Federighi, attempted to counter that during his time on the stand Wednesday, explaining why security for the company’s Mac computers, which supports third-party app distribution, isn’t robust enough for the iPhone. “Today we have a level of malware on the Mac that we don’t find acceptable, and it is much worse than iOS,” he testified. “Put that same situation in place for iOS, and it would be a very, very bad situation for our customers.” He said that Google’s Android operating system was plagued with even more problems. A spokesman for Google pointed to the company’s latest quarterly transparency report that shows less than 0.2% of both consumer and enterprise Android devices have installed a malicious app from Google Play. The judge noted that one of Epic’s expert witnesses had testified there was no real difference between attacks on Android and iPhones. “So what quantitative analysis do you have that would suggest otherwise?” the judge asked. Mr. Federighi noted a report from Nokia that said infections on Android devices were “something like 30 times that of iOS” and said other reports had shown something even more skewed. When Epic’s lawyer, Yonatan Even, got a chance to question Mr. Federighi, he tried to chip away at his statements. Mr. Even questioned his claims about security, and Mr. Federighi said he wasn’t involved in the Nokia study. The two sparred repeatedly over related questions until the judge finally cut them off. “Stop arguing with him,” she said. “Let’s move on.” Phil Schiller, who spent about 20 years as one of Apple’s most senior executives, talked about how much Apple does to help developers succeed at building and growing apps within its marketplace. He said Apple has spent roughly $100 billion on research and development since 2005, including roughly $18 billion in 2020. But Mr. Schiller said he didn’t know if the App Store was profitable on its own, because Apple doesn’t treat it as a stand-alone unit, though he acknowledged that it likely is. Epic’s counsel estimated that the App Store had made at least $20 billion in commissions by 2017 based on data Apple publicly disclosed. Mr. Schiller didn’t dispute that figure. Mr. Cook also echoed testimony of other executives that the company doesn’t break out individual profitability metrics for the store. He generally avoided most discussion about its profitability. When questioned about Apple’s deal that makes Google the default search engine on iPhones, for which the company is paid billions of dollars annually, Mr. Cook said he didn’t know the exact figure. Another part of Epic’s attack on the security of the App Store revolved around the hundreds of workers Apple has reviewing apps before they are made available. In an effort to illustrate that Apple’s processes are porous, Katherine Forrest, an Epic lawyer, told Mr. Schiller that she had done some searches on the App Store. “And I’m now concerned about the algorithm that will be associated with my name forever,” she said as she began going through a binder of pages from her searches that included terms such as “BDSM,” escorts and pornography, and subsequent results of apps ranging from “Sex Position 3D” to one that claimed “pure hookup anonymous.” The questioning came near a break for lunch. Upon returning, Apple’s lawyer, Richard Doren, had a chance to question Mr. Schiller. “Sir, over lunch I became the proud owner of `Sex Positions 3D,’ ” Mr. Doren said. “Do you know whether, in fact, the figures in the app are fully clothed?” Mr. Schiller, now an Apple fellow, said he didn’t know. “I would assume by our store rules, they are.” The app, offered by Weewoo Mobile SL, boasted it could help users “become the best hot lover,” though it came with mixed reviews. Last month, it had an estimated 100,000 downloads and generated $30,000, according to Sensor Tower. The app developer didn’t respond to requests for comment. With the trial now having surpassed a fortnight, Judge Gonzalez Rogers took a moment to ask Epic’s founder and chief executive, Tim Sweeney, what the name “Fortnite” means. Mr. Sweeney said in the original version of the game players must create forts during the day to hide from zombies that come out at night. “So fort-related, as opposed to fortnight, two-week related?” Judge Gonzalez Rogers said. Mr. Sweeney replied that she was correct. “I had to ask,” she said. “I figured I had you here, wasn’t going to have any other real opportunity to ask, so why not.” and Sarah E.

Apple,Economy,9 January 2018,WSJ Pro Central Banking,890 words,0.9963,0.151,0.071,0.777,"English , Inc. ZURICH—Switzerland got a lot wealthier in 2017, thanks to its central bank's emergence as a major money manager with a nearly $800 billion portfolio of foreign stocks and bonds. The Swiss National Bank said Tuesday it expects to report a record annual profit of 54 billion Swiss francs ($55 billion) for last year—a staggering sum equal to 8% of the country's gross domestic product. By comparison, if the Federal Reserve were to run a profit of similar scale relative to the U.S. economy, it would be about $1.5 trillion. The Federal Reserve has earned an annual profit of around $100 billion in recent years. The profit is more than Apple Inc. earns in a year, and more than JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. combined. Those are all giant, world-spanning corporations, while the SNB employs about 800 people. Its chairman—among the best-paid central bankers—earns about $1 million a year. The SNB is one of the few central banks with listed shares . Its share price more than doubled last year, and was up 3.4% Tuesday. But the Swiss National Bankcan't lock in its paper profit by selling chunks of its assets, for fear of lifting the franc's value and hurting exports while weakening consumer prices. That likely will keep its balance sheet at the mercy of financial markets this year. The SNB's profit was lifted by a trio of positive forces: low bond yields preserved the value of its foreign bonds that account for 80% of its foreign reserves, higher stock prices raised the value of its equity holdings, and the weaker Swiss currency made those foreign assets worth more in franc terms. The euro strengthened nearly 10% against the franc last year. Euro-denominated assets are the largest currency holding of the SNB, followed by the dollar. Here's how the SNB profits from buoyant asset markets and a weaker franc. At the end of September, regulatory filings showed it owned more than 19 million shares of Apple, its largest U.S. stockholding. Apple's shares rose nearly 10% in the fourth quarter, which would have added almost $300 million to the SNB's profit, assuming it didn't buy or sell shares. The dollar strengthened 0.7% against the franc during that time, too, which would have added another several million francs when the value of that investment was translated into the Swiss currency. The SNB said 49 billion francs of its profit came from its foreign assets. Its gold holdings increased in value by about three billion francs last year, and its Swiss franc positions by two billion francs. Switzerland's central bank has accumulated about 760 billion francs in foreign bonds and stocks through years of foreign-exchange interventions, particularly during Europe's debt crisis, in which it created francs and used them to purchase foreign assets in a bid to weaken the currency. Other central banks like the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan also have amassed large portfolios consisting primarily of bonds. But those assets are denominated in their own currencies. What sets the SNB apart is that its balance sheet is comprised almost entirely of foreign assets, exposing it to huge foreign-exchange risk. Things haven't always gone the SNB's way. In 2015, the central bank's decision to abandon a ceiling on the franc's value caused the franc to soar in value, leading to a 23 billion-franc loss that year. The Swiss can't spend this latest windfall. Booking its profit would require the SNB to sell some of its foreign bonds and stocks that included nearly $3 billion in Apple stock and $1.5 billion in Facebook Inc. at the end of the third quarter. The SNB's equity investments—which comprise 20% of its foreign assets—replicate broad indexes. And while central banks like the Federal Reserve transfer most of their profits to their governments, the SNB is in the early stages of a five-year profit-sharing arrangement whereby the maximum amount it can transfer to the Swiss federal and regional governments is just two billion francs a year. That agreement runs until 2020. It also pays a small amount—1.5 million francs annually—to its private shareholders. Private shareholders have little or no say over who manages the bank or how it is run. The SNB is mostly owned by Swiss states, known as cantons, and cantonal banks. The SNB said it would allocate about five billion francs to its provisions that guard against future fluctuations in exchange rates. The rest of its paper profit will go to a distribution reserve to ensure that the SNB can still make future payouts even in the event of a loss.

Apple,WSJ Pro,7 September 2021,WSJ Pro Cybersecurity,769 words,-0.8294,0.063,0.072,0.865,"English , Inc. Good day. Apple Inc . is delaying its deployment of tools to detect child pornography on iPhones after privacy advocates voiced concerns about the software, The Wall Street Journal reports. The company announced that it will improve the tool instead of rolling it out later this year as planned. The feature would identify known child pornogrpahy images and alert Apple if a certain number of those were uploaded to its iCloud service. Privacy advocates said the software would be capable of scanning users' phones for other purposes, such as by governments searching for political speech. Apple defended the new tool as privacy friendly because it would only look at images that are uploaded to the cloud and flagged as violations, while other cloud providers use more intrusive technology that scans users' phones.

As part of the latest initiative, the company planned to roll out a system through an iPhone software update later this year that could identify known child-pornography images, then alert Apple if a certain number of those images were uploaded to the company's cloud storage service known as iCloud. Apple had vigorously defended its new program as being privacy friendly, arguing that other cloud providers trying to combat exploitative images rely on technology that scans an entirety of a user's data while Apple had hatched a way to look at only items that were flagged as in violation. Apple 's system wouldn't flag offending content if it wasn't uploaded to the cloud. Privacy experts and critics worried the feature was a signal that the tech giant was softening its posture toward how it protects data via encryption. The company has battled with law enforcement and government officials for years over the ability to harvest encoded data from its devices. Read the full story.

Dozens of groundbreaking originals from Apple TV+ were streamed with family and friends near and afar using SharePlay; hundreds of fun, new and classic games were played on Apple Arcade; and millions of apps were downloaded from the App Store, unlocking powerful ways to communicate, collaborate, and connect.

The efforts, innovation, and creativity of the developers who leverage Apple technology to build these incredible experiences, coupled with the power of the App Store's global platform to connect businesses of all sizes with with over 600 million people each week across 175 countries, has led to developers selling digital goods and services earning more than $260 billion since the App Store launched in 2008. This significant number sets a new yearly record for App Store developer earnings while representing just a small fraction of the overall commerce the App Store facilitates, serving as one meaningful marker of how the ecosystem continues to create opportunities and drive economic expansion for entrepreneurs around the world. This holiday season alone, App Store customers spent more than ever before between Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, driving double-digit growth from last year. 2021 brought a slate of blockbuster launches to the App Store, with the world's leading entertainment companies choosing to premiere marquee movies like ""Black Widow"" from Disney+ and ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" from HBO Max in-app on the same day as their theatrical release. And in October, the App Store launched In-App Events, timely events within apps and games such as game competitions, movie premieres, livestreamed experiences, and more. Standout moments from just the last few months included in-game events like ""The Champions Have Arrived!"" in ""Clash Royale,"" ""Space Tour"" in ""Mario Kart Tour,"" and ""Pokémon GO Halloween Mischief"" in ""Pokémon GO,"" while popular events such as TikTok's ""Stranger Things Watch Party"" and ESPN's ""Man in the Arena: Tom Brady"" drew in-app crowds. Whether through games that exploded onto the scene to become global sensations like ""Royal Match"" from Istanbul's Dream Games, or social apps like Clubhouse, which opened up fascinating conversations to everyone this summer, many of the year's most popular apps and games found new and creative ways to bring people everywhere together. Apps like Bumble and EatOkra were recently honoured among the 2021 App Store Awards winners for delivering best-in-class app experiences, embodying the year's trend of connection.

Share article * Text of this article January 11, 2022 UPDATE Apple services enrich peoples' lives throughout the year In 2021, Apple's services helped deliver innovative apps, powerful content, and transformative experiences that enrich users' lives around the world in more ways than ever before. Apple Fitness+ coached users to stretch, lift, lunge, and meditate their way to healthier days; Apple News kept them informed of pivotal developments in the news and culture; and users started to reexplore the world using the beautiful new Apple Maps. Dozens of groundbreaking originals from Apple TV+ were streamed with family and friends near and afar using SharePlay; hundreds of fun, new and classic games were played on Apple Arcade; and millions of apps were downloaded from the App Store, unlocking powerful ways to communicate, collaborate, and connect. Podcasts like ""The Midnight Miracle"" and ""We Can Do Hard Things"" uplifted listeners, books like ""The Least of Us"" and ""The Love Hypothesis"" moved readers, and when the sun set at the end of each week, and the Work Focus switched off, it was time to celebrate with the Apple Music Award-winning… ""ladies and gentlemen, The Weeknd."" ""Apple's world-class portfolio of services proved essential in 2021, as people worldwide sought new ways to keep entertained, informed, connected, and inspired,"" said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Services. ""With over 745 million paid subscriptions, Apple continues to connect the world's developers, artists, and storytellers with users across more than a billion devices, delivering powerful tools, content, and experiences that enrich their lives in profound ways every day."" Now it's time to reflect on the best of 2021 and look ahead to some of the great new games, music, movies, TV shows, workouts, stories, podcasts, books, guides, and other experiences that await customers in 2022. Apps and games have become the essential source for the world's most innovative and timely entertainment. The efforts, innovation, and creativity of the developers who leverage Apple technology to build these incredible experiences, coupled with the power of the App Store's global platform to connect businesses of all sizes with with over 600 million people each week across 175 countries, has led to developers selling digital goods and services earning more than $260 billion since the App Store launched in 2008. This significant number sets a new yearly record for App Store developer earnings while representing just a small fraction of the overall commerce the App Store facilitates, serving as one meaningful marker of how the ecosystem continues to create opportunities and drive economic expansion for entrepreneurs around the world. This holiday season alone, App Store customers spent more than ever before between Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, driving double-digit growth from last year. 2021 brought a slate of blockbuster launches to the App Store, with the world's leading entertainment companies choosing to premiere marquee movies like ""Black Widow"" from Disney+ and ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" from HBO Max in-app on the same day as their theatrical release.

Standout moments from just the last few months included in-game events like ""The Champions Have Arrived!"" in ""Clash Royale,"" ""Space Tour"" in ""Mario Kart Tour,"" and ""Pokémon GO Halloween Mischief"" in ""Pokémon GO,"" while popular events such as TikTok's ""Stranger Things Watch Party"" and ESPN's ""Man in the Arena: Tom Brady"" drew in-app crowds. Whether through games that exploded onto the scene to become global sensations like ""Royal Match"" from Istanbul's Dream Games, or social apps like Clubhouse, which opened up fascinating conversations to everyone this summer, many of the year's most popular apps and games found new and creative ways to bring people everywhere together. Apps like Bumble and EatOkra were recently honoured among the 2021 App Store Awards winners for delivering best-in-class app experiences, embodying the year's trend of connection. Lists of the year's most downloaded apps and games are available on the App Store.

Apple Card Family also allows two people to co-own an Apple Card, and share and merge their credit lines while building credit together equally. Apple Pay* provided even more customers with a secure and easy way to pay in-store and online around the world after expanding to nine new markets in 2021, including Colombia, Israel, and Mexico. Today, Apple Pay is available in nearly 60 countries and regions, and works with nearly 9,000 bank partners worldwide. Apple also continues to deliver on its vision of replacing customers' physical wallets with Wallet, an easy-to-use and secure digital wallet. Wallet helped customers access important information about their health in 2021, with the ability to add and view verifiable COVID-19 vaccination cards, and in Australia, health insurance cards. Digital tickets in Wallet helped venues and their guests create safe, contactless experiences, and last year, customers used 30 million NFC tickets in Wallet for events across music, sports, theatre, and more across the US and Canada. The ability for customers to simply tap their iPhone or Apple Watch to pay and ride transit is now available in more than 200 cities across the globe after recently debuting in China (Nanchang and Foshan), Russia (Kazan), and Sweden (Malmo), as well as in San Francisco with the Clipper card. Student IDs in Wallet helped university students in the US and Canada safely and securely get around campus. And for travellers, Apple rolled out the first hotel room keys at select Hyatt properties in the US while also unlocking magical moments for Walt Disney World visitors with Disney MagicMobile passes in Wallet. Users can look forward to support for home keys and corporate badges, as well as state IDs and driver's licenses, this year. Apple Maps received its biggest update ever last year with a three-dimensional city experience that features more realistic and colourful details, driving routes with better navigation, immersive walking directions shown in augmented reality, and much more. The new visually stunning 3D map showcases unprecedented detail for neighbourhoods and commercial districts, elevation details across a city, custom-designed landmarks, and a beautiful nighttime mode with a moonlit glow that activates at dusk. The detailed city experience is available for iPhone and CarPlay users in London, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Diego, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., and will be available in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver this year. Maps also introduced an enhanced navigation experience with additional road details that help drivers navigate through cities more easily and safely; powerful transit updates that allow users to pin their favourite lines in Maps, and receive notifications on iPhone or Apple Watch when it's time to disembark a selected route; and step-by-step walking guidance in augmented reality. With faster, more accurate navigation and comprehensive views of roads, buildings, parks, airports, and malls, Maps makes it easier and more enjoyable to map out any journey across iPhone, iPad, Mac, or while in the car with CarPlay. The new map, built from the ground up, continues to roll out to more countries and regions. Last year, the new map expanded beyond Canada, Ireland, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States to include Australia, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Curated Guides in Maps make it easy to discover the amazing things to see and do in cities, and in 2021, new Guides were added from trusted resources like Thrillist, the Smithsonian Institution, and FATMAP. Now Maps features Guides from more than 100 trusted resources, so users can check out what authors like Bryant Terry and María Amparo Escandón recommend in their favourite cities, what Atlas Obscura suggests for ""The World's Most Interesting Restaurants,"" or what Culture Trip suggests for ""The Most Beautiful Hidden Beaches in the World."" iCloud has always kept a customer's important information like photos, documents, app data, and notes safe, up to date, and accessible across their devices. The introduction of iCloud+, a new paid subscription, combines everything customers love about iCloud with powerful new features for paid subscribers, all for the same low prices.2 Features of iCloud+ include iCloud Private Relay, an innovative new service that protects privacy online; Hide My Email, an easy way to create a unique, random email address that forwards to a personal inbox; expanded HomeKit Secure Video recording so customers can set up all the cameras they need to keep an eye on their home; and Custom Email Domain, so customers can personalise their iCloud email address. All plans can be shared with people in the same Family Sharing group, so everyone can enjoy the new features, storage, and elevated experience that comes with iCloud+.

As included in the Information * Click here to view this its original format Apple services enrich people's lives throughout the year UPDATE 11 January 2022 Apple services enrich people's lives throughout the year In 2021, Apple's services helped deliver innovative apps, powerful content and transformative experiences that enrich users' lives around the world in more ways than ever before. Apple Fitness+ coached users to stretch, lift, lunge and meditate their way to healthier days; Apple News kept them informed of pivotal developments in the news and culture; and users started to re-explore the world using the beautiful new Apple Maps. Dozens of groundbreaking originals from Apple TV+ were streamed with family and friends near and afar using SharePlay; hundreds of fun, new and classic games were played on Apple Arcade; and millions of apps were downloaded from the App Store, unlocking powerful ways to communicate, collaborate and connect. Podcasts like ""The Midnight Miracle"" and ""We Can Do Hard Things"" uplifted listeners, books like ""The Least of Us"" and ""The Love Hypothesis"" moved readers, and when the sun set at the end of each week, and the Work Focus switched off, it was time to celebrate with the Apple Music Award-winning… ""ladies and gentlemen, The Weeknd"". ""Apple's world-class portfolio of services proved essential in 2021, as people worldwide sought new ways to keep entertained, informed, connected and inspired,"" said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Services. ""With over 745 million paid subscriptions, Apple continues to connect the world's developers, artists and storytellers with users across more than a billion devices, delivering powerful tools, content and experiences that enrich their lives in profound ways every day."" Now it's time to reflect on the best of 2021 and look ahead to some of the great new games, music, movies, TV shows, workouts, stories, podcasts, books, guides and other experiences that await customers in 2022. Apps and games are essential in helping people around the world work, play, create and connect. Apps and games have become the essential source for the world's most innovative and timely entertainment. The efforts, innovation and creativity of the developers who leverage Apple technology to build these incredible experiences, coupled with the power of the App Store's global platform to connect businesses of all sizes with over 600 million people each week across 175 countries, has led to developers selling digital goods and services earning more than US$260 billion since the App Store launched in 2008. This significant number sets a new yearly record for App Store developer earnings while representing just a small fraction of the overall commerce the App Store facilitates, serving as one meaningful marker of how the ecosystem continues to create opportunities and drive economic expansion for entrepreneurs around the world. This holiday season alone, App Store customers spent more than ever before between Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, driving double-digit growth from last year. 2021 brought a slate of blockbuster launches to the App Store, with the world's leading entertainment companies choosing to premiere marquee movies like ""Black Widow"" from Disney+ and ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" from HBO Max in-app on the same day as their theatrical release. And in October, the App Store launched In-App Events, timely events within apps and games such as game competitions, movie premieres, livestreamed experiences and more. Stand-out moments from just the last few months included in-game events like ""The Champions Have Arrived!"" in ""Clash Royale"", ""Space Tour"" in ""Mario Kart Tour"" and ""Pokémon GO Halloween Mischief"" in ""Pokémon GO"", while popular events such as TikTok's ""Stranger Things Watch Party"" and ESPN's ""Man in the Arena: Tom Brady"" drew in-app crowds. Whether through games that exploded onto the scene to become global sensations like ""Royal Match"" from Istanbul's Dream Games, or social apps like Clubhouse, which opened up fascinating conversations to everyone this winter, many of the year's most popular apps and games found new and creative ways to bring people everywhere together. Apps like Bumble and EatOkra were recently honoured among the 2021 App Store Awards winners for delivering best-in-class app experiences, embodying the year's trend of connection. Lists of the year's most downloaded apps and games are available on the App Store. * ""Sneaky Sasquatch"" from Apple Arcade on iPad Pro. * ""The Oregon Trail"" from Apple Arcade on iPad Pro. Apple Arcade features hundreds of fun new games, such as ""Sneaky Sasquatch"" from RAC7 Games and ""The Oregon Trail"" from Gameloft.

Now, subscribers can enjoy original games like ""Sneaky Sasquatch"", ""NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition"", ""The Oregon Trail"", and the recently released ""LEGO Star Wars: Castaways"" and ""Disney Melee Mania"".

This year, players can look forward to the release of new, highly anticipated games, including ""Nickelodeon Extreme Tennis"", and enjoy new content updates added weekly. Listen to tens of thousands of songs in spatial audio with Dolby Atmos for a truly immersive audio experience. 2021 was a year of innovation for Apple Music, providing subscribers with remarkable new releases, original content, and product features that transformed the experience of discovering and enjoying music from all over the world. Apple Music offers listeners one of the largest music catalogues ever, now featuring over 90 million songs all available in lossless audio, so that fans can hear music the way artists created it. Spatial audio with Dolby Atmos and support for dynamic head tracking have ushered in the next generation of sound, providing artists the ability to deliver immersive audio experiences with exceptional clarity, while bringing listeners deeper into their all-time and new favourite songs. New features including autoplay, lyrics share, city charts, motion cover art, enhanced search, Shared with You and the redesigned Listen Now tab make the experience of discovering music a delight, while Apple Music TV on the Apple TV app, Apple Music in Apple News and support for Apple Music across FaceTime with SharePlay, Apple Fitness+ and Memories in Photos extend the experience across the Apple ecosystem.

Apple Music Radio - which includes Apple Music 1, Apple Music Hits and Apple Music Country - delivers an award-winning music listening and discovery experience to tens of millions of subscribers worldwide, with exclusive radio shows from the most beloved artists and well-respected hosts in the business.

Last year, millions of people asked Siri to play music and, last month, Apple Music launched the Voice Plan, a new subscription tier powered by Siri. The Apple Music Voice Plan offers subscribers access to Apple Music's entire catalogue - including tens of thousands of new mood and activity playlists, personalised mixes, genre stations and the award-winning Apple Music Radio - through a simple user interface for just A$5.99 inc. GST per month. The Apple Music Voice Plan, designed around the power of Siri, is available now in 17 countries and regions. In a first for music streaming, and as part of Apple's ongoing mission to support the global artist community, Apple Music leveraged Shazam's unmatched technology to identify the creators featured in the thousands of popular DJ mixes available on the service so that they can be compensated for their contributions. Apple Music also launched support for record label pages to help listeners find more great music from those behind the artists they already enjoy. Later this year, listeners can look forward to even more global premieres, exclusives, in-depth interviews, livestreams, DJ mixes, and the world's best streaming experience for classical music with the most beloved features of Primephonic, plus even better browsing and search capabilities, detailed displays of classical music metadata and much more. * Apple TV+ banner for ""The Tragedy of Macbeth"". * Apple TV+ banner for ""The Afterparty"". * Apple TV+ banner for ""Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock"". * Apple TV+ banner for ""Servant"".

Share article * Text of this article 11 January 2022 UPDATE Apple services enrich people's lives throughout the year In 2021, Apple's services helped deliver innovative apps, powerful content and transformative experiences that enrich users' lives around the world in more ways than ever before. Apple Fitness+ coached users to stretch, lift, lunge and meditate their way to healthier days; Apple News kept them informed of pivotal developments in the news and culture; and users started to re-explore the world using the beautiful new Apple Maps. Dozens of groundbreaking originals from Apple TV+ were streamed with family and friends near and afar using SharePlay; hundreds of fun, new and classic games were played on Apple Arcade; and millions of apps were downloaded from the App Store, unlocking powerful ways to communicate, collaborate and connect. Podcasts like ""The Midnight Miracle"" and ""We Can Do Hard Things"" uplifted listeners, books like ""The Least of Us"" and ""The Love Hypothesis"" moved readers, and when the sun set at the end of each week, and the Work Focus switched off, it was time to celebrate with the Apple Music Award-winning… ""ladies and gentlemen, The Weeknd"". ""Apple's world-class portfolio of services proved essential in 2021, as people worldwide sought new ways to keep entertained, informed, connected and inspired,"" said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Services. ""With over 745 million paid subscriptions, Apple continues to connect the world's developers, artists and storytellers with users across more than a billion devices, delivering powerful tools, content and experiences that enrich their lives in profound ways every day."" Now it's time to reflect on the best of 2021 and look ahead to some of the great new games, music, movies, TV shows, workouts, stories, podcasts, books, guides and other experiences that await customers in 2022. Apps and games have become the essential source for the world's most innovative and timely entertainment. The efforts, innovation and creativity of the developers who leverage Apple technology to build these incredible experiences, coupled with the power of the App Store's global platform to connect businesses of all sizes with over 600 million people each week across 175 countries, has led to developers selling digital goods and services earning more than US$260 billion since the App Store launched in 2008. This significant number sets a new yearly record for App Store developer earnings while representing just a small fraction of the overall commerce the App Store facilitates, serving as one meaningful marker of how the ecosystem continues to create opportunities and drive economic expansion for entrepreneurs around the world. This holiday season alone, App Store customers spent more than ever before between Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, driving double-digit growth from last year. 2021 brought a slate of blockbuster launches to the App Store, with the world's leading entertainment companies choosing to premiere marquee movies like ""Black Widow"" from Disney+ and ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" from HBO Max in-app on the same day as their theatrical release. And in October, the App Store launched In-App Events, timely events within apps and games such as game competitions, movie premieres, livestreamed experiences and more. Stand-out moments from just the last few months included in-game events like ""The Champions Have Arrived!"" in ""Clash Royale"", ""Space Tour"" in ""Mario Kart Tour"" and ""Pokémon GO Halloween Mischief"" in ""Pokémon GO"", while popular events such as TikTok's ""Stranger Things Watch Party"" and ESPN's ""Man in the Arena: Tom Brady"" drew in-app crowds. Whether through games that exploded onto the scene to become global sensations like ""Royal Match"" from Istanbul's Dream Games, or social apps like Clubhouse, which opened up fascinating conversations to everyone this winter, many of the year's most popular apps and games found new and creative ways to bring people everywhere together. Apps like Bumble and EatOkra were recently honoured among the 2021 App Store Awards winners for delivering best-in-class app experiences, embodying the year's trend of connection. Lists of the year's most downloaded apps and games are available on the App Store. Last year, Apple Arcade's award-winning library of games saw its biggest expansion yet, now offering players of all ages over 200 premium, family-friendly games, including brand-new releases from the world's best developers, award-winning titles and beloved favourites from the App Store - all without ads or in-app purchases. Now, subscribers can enjoy original games like ""Sneaky Sasquatch"", ""NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition"", ""The Oregon Trail"", and the recently released ""LEGO Star Wars: Castaways"" and ""Disney Melee Mania"". Players can also jump into award-winning titles like ""Monument Valley"", ""Mini Metro"" and ""Galaga Wars"", and revisit timeless classics such as ""Solitaire by MobilityWare"" and ""Good Sudoku by Zach Gage"". Apple Arcade games support Apple's high user privacy standards, and can be shared with up to five family members using Family Sharing with just one all-inclusive subscription. This year, players can look forward to the release of new, highly anticipated games, including ""Nickelodeon Extreme Tennis"", and enjoy new content updates added weekly. 2021 was a year of innovation for Apple Music, providing subscribers with remarkable new releases, original content, and product features that transformed the experience of discovering and enjoying music from all over the world. Apple Music offers listeners one of the largest music catalogues ever, now featuring over 90 million songs all available in lossless audio, so that fans can hear music the way artists created it. Spatial audio with Dolby Atmos and support for dynamic head tracking have ushered in the next generation of sound, providing artists the ability to deliver immersive audio experiences with exceptional clarity, while bringing listeners deeper into their all-time and new favourite songs. New features including autoplay, lyrics share, city charts, motion cover art, enhanced search, Shared with You and the redesigned Listen Now tab make the experience of discovering music a delight, while Apple Music TV on the Apple TV app, Apple Music in Apple News and support for Apple Music across FaceTime with SharePlay, Apple Fitness+ and Memories in Photos extend the experience across the Apple ecosystem. Apple Music Radio - which includes Apple Music 1, Apple Music Hits and Apple Music Country - delivers an award-winning music listening and discovery experience to tens of millions of subscribers worldwide, with exclusive radio shows from the most beloved artists and well-respected hosts in the business. Throughout last year, Apple Music Radio hosts connected with the world's biggest superstars - including ABBA, Adele, Brandi Carlile, BTS, Coldplay, Kacey Musgraves, Lil Nas X, Lizzo, Megan Thee Stallion, Metallica, Mick Jagger, Neil Young and Silk Sonic - for in-depth interviews and global exclusives. Apple Music also hosted a series of culture-moving livestreams, including Kanye West's ""Donda"" release streams; ""Rap Life Live"" with Moneybagg Yo, Saweetie and Lil Durk; and the expanded Apple Music Awards featuring The Weeknd, Olivia Rodrigo, H.E.R., Wizkid, Scriptonite, Aya Nakamura, RIN and Official HIGE DANdism, helping fans stay connected to these history-making moments in music across the globe. Last year, millions of people asked Siri to play music and, last month, Apple Music launched the Voice Plan, a new subscription tier powered by Siri. The Apple Music Voice Plan offers subscribers access to Apple Music's entire catalogue - including tens of thousands of new mood and activity playlists, personalised mixes, genre stations and the award-winning Apple Music Radio - through a simple user interface for just A$5.99 inc. GST per month. In a first for music streaming, and as part of Apple's ongoing mission to support the global artist community, Apple Music leveraged Shazam's unmatched technology to identify the creators featured in the thousands of popular DJ mixes available on the service so that they can be compensated for their contributions. Apple Music also launched support for record label pages to help listeners find more great music from those behind the artists they already enjoy. Later this year, listeners can look forward to even more global premieres, exclusives, in-depth interviews, livestreams, DJ mixes, and the world's best streaming experience for classical music with the most beloved features of Primephonic, plus even better browsing and search capabilities, detailed displays of classical music metadata and much more. In just two years, Apple TV+ has made streaming history by achieving major milestones in a short span of time. Apple TV+ has been honoured with 763 award nominations and 190 wins, including Academy Award and BAFTA Award nominations, 12 Primetime Emmy Award wins across major program categories, Daytime Emmy Awards, SAG Awards, NAACP Image Awards, Peabody Awards, AFI Awards, Critics Choice Awards, Critics Choice Documentary Awards, Kidscreen Awards and many more. New Apple Original series and films captivated audiences around the world with culture-moving programs such as ""Ted Lasso"", which continues to break records and recently became the most nominated freshman comedy in Emmy Award history, landing four Emmys, including Outstanding Comedy Series. Celebrated new Apple Original Films ""The Tragedy of Macbeth"", ""CODA"", ""Swan Song"", ""Finch"" and ""The Velvet Underground"" continue to draw buzz and acclaim with film critic groups, as well as global audiences. Last year, Apple TV+ premiered gripping new original series, including ""The Shrink Next Door"", ""Invasion"", ""Swagger"", ""The Mosquito Coast"", ""Physical"", ""Foundation"", ""Schmigadoon!"", ""Mr. Corman"", ""The Problem with Jon Stewart"", the service's first bilingual series ""Acapulco"" and its first Korean-language Original ""Dr. Brain"". This year, subscribers will be able to enjoy even more highly anticipated Apple Originals from internationally renowned storytellers, including ""WeCrashed"", ""The Afterparty"", ""Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock"", ""Severance"" and ""Suspicion"", as well as new seasons of returning favourites such as ""Servant"", ""Mythic Quest"", ""Ted Lasso"", ""Physical"", ""Truth Be Told"" and ""Morning Wars"". All Apple Original series and films are available on the Apple TV app, accessible from over a billion devices, including popular smart TVs from LG, Panasonic, Samsung, Sony, TCL, VIZIO and others; Amazon Fire TV and Roku devices; and PlayStation and Xbox gaming consoles. The Apple TV app launched on Android TV, Chromecast with Google TV, Sky Q set-top boxes and Sky Glass TVs last year, and will soon launch on Comcast Xfinity set-top boxes. The Apple TV app also offers viewers a personalised guide to their favourite TV shows, sports and films across other popular streaming services, channels and pay TV providers. New features, including For All of You, SharePlay and the Store tab, now make it easier to find personalised recommendations, watch with friends and family, and buy, rent or stream favourites all in one place. The next-generation Apple TV4K, which launched last autumn with the all-new Siri Remote, offers customers the best way to enjoy Apple Originals from Apple TV+ and more using the Apple TV app. Apple TV 4K and Siri Remote are available in 24 countries and regions, including Belgium, Hong Kong and Russia, allowing even more users to interact with Siri in their native language. And, for the first time, customers in South Korea can enjoy Apple TV 4K, the Apple TV app and Apple TV+ through SK Broadband. As the new year begins, Apple Fitness+ continues to motivate people around the world to close their rings and live a healthier day, both mentally and physically. On 10 January, Fitness+ introduced Time to Run, an audio running experience designed to help users become more consistent and better runners, featuring popular running routes in selected major cities; and Collections, a curated series of workouts and meditations from the Fitness+ library organised to help users reach a goal. Fitness+ also introduced the third season of Time to Walk, featuring guests such as award-winning actor Rebel Wilson, advocate and minister Bernice A. King, and actor and comedian Hasan Minhaj. Fitness+ will also introduce new Artist Spotlight workouts featuring music from Ed Sheeran, Pharrell Williams, Shakira and The Beatles. Every day, users share inspirational stories on how their lives have been changed by Fitness+. Since launching just over a year ago, Fitness+ has expanded its library to feature almost 2,000 studio-style sessions, the largest library of workout content in 4K Ultra High Definition, covering 11 different workout types - including HIIT, Strength, Core, Yoga, Pilates, Dance, Cycling, Rowing, Treadmill (for running and walking) and Mindful Cooldown - with new content added each week. This past year, Fitness+ also introduced guided meditation, a simple way to practise mindfulness at any time, anywhere and improve overall wellbeing.

Acknowledging the power of music, the service also launched an Artist Spotlight series featuring playlists by artists such as Alicia Keys, The Beatles, Billie Eilish, Calvin Harris, Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban and Shakira. In the same year, Fitness+ introduced new ways to work out or meditate together with SharePlay and expanded to 15 new countries, broadening its global footprint to reach more people around the world. Fitness+ helps users train their body and mind with a one-of-a-kind personalised and engaging experience that can be done at any time, anywhere; intelligently incorporates workout metrics from Apple Watch right on the screen; and motivates users from start to finish with music from today's top artists. When browsing for a workout, Fitness+ also makes personalised recommendations based on a user's workout history so that no matter what their fitness level is, it is easy to find a workout with More of What You Do and Try Something New. With new content, more trainers and greater availability worldwide, it's easier than ever to get started with Fitness+, and in 2022, there is even more to come. Apple News continues to be the number-one news app in all markets where it is available. Last year, Apple News launched local news experiences in six additional US cities - Charlotte, Miami, Sacramento, San Antonio, San Diego and Washington DC - and introduced the extremely popular ""Read Local"" collection that encourages a US audience to engage with the best stories from local publications every week. Each weekday morning, Apple News Today continues to take listeners inside the most fascinating stories in the news, and how the world's best journalists are covering them.

Today, Apple Pay is available in nearly 60 countries and regions, and works with nearly 9,000 bank partners worldwide. Apple also continues to deliver on its vision of replacing customers' physical wallets with Wallet, an easy-to-use and secure digital wallet.

Digital tickets in Wallet helped venues and their guests create safe, contactless experiences, and last year, customers used 30 million NFC tickets in Wallet for events across music, sports, theatre and more across the US and Canada.

Apple,Tech,31 January 2018,WSJ Pro Financial Regulation,874 words,-0.8999,0.052,0.065,0.883,"English , Inc. Apple Inc. is being investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission over potential securities violations related to the company's disclosure of a software update that slowed older iPhones, people familiar with the matter said. The two probes add pressure on the tech giant to address criticism from customers and lawmakers after it acknowledged in December that it was throttling the performance of older iPhones as batteries aged. The company later apologized for the issue and slashed the price of an iPhone battery replacement to $29 from $79, hoping to win back customer goodwill. Apple acknowledged in a statement that it is responding to questions from some government agencies, though it declined to disclose which agencies or any details regarding the questions. It also reiterated what it said in December, noting that it has ""never—and would never—do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades."" The news of the investigations was reported earlier by Bloomberg. Regulators and prosecutors often open investigations that don't result in any charges being filed, and securities investigations often take more than a year. It isn't clear why federal officials are focusing on potential securities violations involving an issue affecting customers. Generally in such a case, the SEC could try to fault a public company for failing to make timely disclosures about material information that would affect the stock price. The company's potential liability would probably turn on whether the fallout from poor battery performance was likely to be material and whether the company delayed disclosing it or had the proper systems to detect and account for it. Apple's stock has fallen about 4% since Apple's acknowledgment, but much of the losses have occurred in the past week ahead of Thursday's planned quarterly earnings report. Some of the declines have come amid reports of possible weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone X. On Tuesday, Apple's shares fell 0.6% to $166.97. Still, some analysts have said the battery issues could hit Apple's financials. Barclays said in a note this month that Apple could sell 16 million fewer iPhones this year, and lose $10.29 billion in revenue, directly related to customers choosing to replace batteries rather than replace their iPhones. Apple last week announced it will release a spring software update with a feature that shows an iPhone battery's health and recommends when it needs to be serviced. Customers also will be able to see if the power-throttling feature is being used on their device and switch it off. During an interview with ABC News earlier this month, Chief Executive Tim Cook said last year's update was designed to prevent users from having their phone power off during a call or while taking a photograph. He said Apple made the change to improve customers' experience and that Apple disclosed the feature at the time, though, he said people may not have been paying attention. ""Maybe we should have been clearer, as well,"" Mr. Cook said. ""We deeply apologize to anybody that thinks we had some other kind of motivation because our motivation is always the user."" Since acknowledging it throttled iPhone performance, the company has faced questions from consumer and watchdog groups in France, Italy and China. In France, the Paris prosecutor's office said early this month it opened an investigation into Apple for potential deception and ""programmed obsolescence."" The investigation could lead to preliminary charges or be dropped. Earlier this month, U.S. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, sent Mr. Cook a letter seeking more information on how the company tracked customer complaints of processing performance and whether or not it considered offering rebates to customers who had replaced their batteries at a higher price. Apple hasn't commented on the French investigation or Mr. Thune's letter. Battery life and processing speeds are two of the most important features on smartphones. To prevent iPhone 6, 6s and SE devices from powering off automatically—something that drew complaints last year from Chinese consumer-protection groups—Apple said it updated its operating system, iOS, to slow certain tasks that required more computing power than a device could provide. It expanded the practice to the iPhone 7 in the fall. The Apple investigations add to a mounting list of clashes between the Trump administration and tech firms over the past year, including a rollback of internet regulations that Silicon Valley had championed during the Obama era. Tech firms also have run into political trouble lately in Congress, particularly over alleged Russian online meddling in the 2016 election, but also user privacy concerns and liability for online sex trafficking.

Apple,"Tech Shares Stage Rebound --- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon lead as growth returns to top of investors' buy lists",12 July 2021,The Wall Street Journal,745 words,0.9924,0.11,0.019,0.87,"Shares of big technology companies have been flying past the rest of the market. After languishing for months, the group has staged a resurgence with several tech behemoths hitting records in recent sessions. Apple Inc. shares closed at a record Friday after notching their first new high since January earlier in the week. Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. shares also jumped to records Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. ""I'm very bullish on companies that can provide strong organic growth and predictable growth,"" said Dev Kantesaria, founder of Valley Forge Capital who said he recently added to his Amazon holdings. ""Certainly the big technology companies will be able to do that."" Some investors and analysts say they have become less optimistic that the U.S. economy's recovery will sustain its strong momentum. Lackluster economic data over the past week and fears about the Delta variant of the Covid-19 virus have stoked volatility in stock and bond markets. Eight tech heavyweights accounted for more than half of the S&P 500's 7.3% gain from May 12, when the index hit a near-term low, through early July, according to a Bespoke Investment Group note Thursday. Apple, Amazon, Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc., Microsoft, Netflix Inc., Nvidia Corp., and Tesla Inc. pushed the broader index to new highs. The strong showing for tech marks a sharp shift from earlier in the year. For many months, investors had fled the government-bond market and scooped up shares of companies that would prosper if the U.S. economy continued its rapid recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Energy companies and shares of big banks and other financial firms soared as Treasury yields edged higher. Those wagers have crumbled in recent sessions, highlighting the turbulence among stocks that has been a staple of this year, despite an ascendant market. The tech sector's recent win marks a revival of a trade that flourished in 2020, helping drive the S&P 500's recovery for much of last year. Anchoring the run for growth companies are dwindling bond yields. Investors have stampeded into Treasurys, sending the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to the lowest level since February as bond prices have rallied. Many individual investors have also piled in, snapping up exchange-traded funds that track bonds, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists. The low yields have boosted the outlook for tech and growth bets that investors think could keep delivering strong results during a sluggish stretch for the broader economy, reviving a trade that worked for much of last year, and even the last decade. ""The 10-year -- which seems to be the one thing that's driving how people are positioned in the market -- has defied all odds and predictions. It's led a rotation,"" said John Porter, chief investment officer of equities at Mellon Investments. ""When you look at the broader indices, it's relatively smooth sailing. Underneath the surface there have been wild changes."" Goldman Sachs analysts recently said they expect slowing economic growth to buoy growth stocks in the second half, though the sector will remain volatile. The firm expects the economic growth rate to peak in the third quarter and decelerate later in 2021. In the coming week, investors will be parsing data on inflation as well as earnings from banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for more clues on the recovery, as well as the path of cyclical stocks like banks. Rising interest rates can be problematic for growth and tech firms, in part because their earnings are expected to come in the future. Rising yields make the current value of earnings more attractive relative to future ones. Some investors say that buying shares of value companies like energy and financial firms hasn't run its course yet, and that those groups will rally. But many investors are struggling to position for the next phase of the recovery. The recent shift marks a test case for a stock market that has already staged a strong rally in the first half -- with the S&P 500 hitting 38 highs in 2021 -- fueled by the prospect of a robust economic recovery. ""I think it means that gains in the market are going to be harder to come by,"" said Eddie Perkin, chief investment officer of equities at Eaton Vance."
Apple,Today's Markets,27 April 2020,The Wall Street Journal Online,892 words,0.974,0.096,0.065,0.839,"Stocks rose Monday, with investors betting that stimulus measures and the easing of coronavirus-lockdown measures around the world could help kick-start economic activity. Some U.S. states allowed retailers, salons and other businesses to reopen over the weekend as new infections appeared to slow. To investors, the moves offered a tentative sign of hope--although many caution that the trajectory of the pandemic remains highly uncertain. ""We don't yet know the full scale and the pace of lockdowns being eased, but it's important for confidence,"" said Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald. ""Suggestions that factories will restart sooner rather than later suggests that the pressure on economic output in the data we've seen will be a shorter-lived phenomenon."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 358.51 points, or 1.5%, to 24133.78. The S&P 500 added 41.74 points, or 1.5%, to 2878.48 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 95.64 points, or 1.1%, to 8730.16. Signs of the coronavirus pandemic's financial toll rippled across markets. General Motors shares rose 50 cents, or 2.3%, to $22.45 after the company said it was suspending its dividend and share repurchase program as part of an effort to conserve cash. Apple missed out on much of the broader market's gains Monday following a report that it was pushing back a ramp-up in production of new iPhones by about a month. The pandemic has dented consumer demand for a variety of products, as well as disrupted supply chains across the world. Shares of Apple ended the day up 20 cents, or 0.1%, to $283.17 after trading lower earlier. Later this week, investors say they will be closely focused on the outcome from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank's meetings. Recent economic data and forecasts from many countries have been weak, prompting policy makers to take unprecedented steps and allocate huge sums to support businesses and individuals whose finances have taken a hit. ""Normally when you have a recession, there are a number of factors that are reining in credit and stimulus and that's not the case here,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. A flood of U.S. companies—including Amazon.com, Apple and Facebook— are also scheduled to report first-quarter results in the coming days. They are likely to provide insights on how leaders of the biggest American businesses view prospects for the rest of the year. But the pandemic has made earnings forecasts even less reliable than normal, analysts and investors said. ""Most investors are looking through the earnings reports as somewhat meaningless because we've never had this mix of fall-off in demand and central bank, government stimulus support before,"" Mr. Haefele said. Elsewhere, European markets climbed as countries including Italy and Spain signaled that they may loosen restrictions in the coming weeks. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.8%. Italy unveiled a timetable for reopening its economy and restoring daily life beginning May 4, but warned that a resurgence in cases could lead to a return of restrictions. Spain allowed children to leave their homes after six weeks under one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. Concerns about sovereign debt from Europe's most debt-laden countries also showed signs of easing. Italian, Spanish and Greek bonds rallied after S&P Global Ratings on Friday held off on downgrading Italy's credit rating. ""Markets at the tail end of last week were fixated on European political risk, and a run on debt markets triggered by a downgrade for Italy,"" said Mr. Park. ""The lack of a downgrade offers some breathing space."" In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index ended the day up 2.7%. The Bank of Japanscrapped its target for government-bond purchases and said it would nearly triple its holdings of corporate debt to aid fundraising by companies affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite closed 0.3% higher after China's statistics bureau released data showing that industrial companies' profits in March were down 34.9% from a year earlier, a slight improvement from the 38.3% pace of decline in January-February. The country last month began reopening some industrial hubs after closing most factories and companies to curb the coronavirus's spread. Central banks' stimulus policies and other government measures to subsidize wages are all helping to buoy markets and asset prices, said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank NV in Hong Kong. ""They will take a while to reach the real economy,"" she said, adding that the path to increasing consumption is unlikely to be smooth. Oil prices dropped sharply with traders skittish about the world's ability to house a glut of crude. West Texas Intermediate futures, considered the benchmark for U.S. crude prices, tumbled 25% to $12.78 a barrel. , Xie Yu at Yu.Xie@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com (""mailto:akane.otani@wsj.com"")"

Ms. Sandberg later confided in friends that she wondered if she should be worried about her job. Last year the Journal also wrote a series of investigative stories about the company, called The Facebook Files, that was based on thousands of internal documents and described the flaws in its platforms and the harms they cause users, among other issues.

Facebook's shift away from using its facial-recognition system will also affect a technology called automatic alt text, which is used for making image descriptions for those visually impaired, Mr. Pesenti said. That technology won't try to identify each person featured in a photo using facial recognition anymore, but it will still be able to determine the number of people in a photo, he said.

Meta_Facebook,"*Meta Is Working With DoorDash to Deliver Items Sold on Facebook Marketplace, Companies Say -- WSJ",12 August 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,340 words",0.9885,0.064,0.015,0.921,"English , Inc. 12 Aug 2022 *Facebook Partnership With DoorDash Launched in Several U.S. Cities, Companies Say -- WSJ 12 Aug 2022 *Partnership Applies to Deliveries Within 15 Miles, Sources Say -- WSJ 12 Aug 2022 Facebook Marketplace, DoorDash Team Up for Local Deliveries -- WSJ By Salvador Rodriguez and Preetika Rana Drivers for DoorDash Inc. are now delivering items to consumers purchased online from Facebook Marketplace as part of a new partnership between the delivery app and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. The deal is an attempt to get more people, especially younger ones, to use Facebook, while boosting DoorDash's ambition to expand into delivering more than food. Meta and DoorDash tested the service in several U.S. cities in recent months, the companies said. The service lets Facebook users purchase and receive items from Marketplace without leaving their homes. It can deliver items that fit in a car trunk and are up to 15 miles away, people familiar with the plan said. Deliveries would be made within 48 hours, the people said. Meta and DoorDash confirmed the tests and said the partnership is in early stages. The companies have been offering free delivery to entice customers to try the service, according to one of the people familiar with the plan. It couldn't be determined how the companies would charge for deliveries in the future. For Meta, the idea behind the partnership was to try to get more people, especially younger ones, to use Marketplace more often, according to a person familiar with its plans. Marketplace is a feature within Facebook that lets people sell new and used goods to one another. Facebook has struggled to add younger users, who now prefer rival TikTok. Marketplace has been one of the few Facebook features popular among young people, the person said. Over the past two years, Meta has increased its efforts to expand e-commerce on its social-media apps because it would help it sell ads. The company lost ad revenue over the past year after Apple Inc. changed its privacy policy for iPhones and iPads. The changes, made in April 2021, made it easier for people to stop apps from tracking their devices. That tracking data helped Meta measure the effectiveness of advertisements. Increased use of Facebook Marketplace would help Meta better measure the effectiveness of ads, and reclaim some of the data it lost after Apple changed its policy, because commerce channels provide more-detailed data for advertising. The partnership comes after Meta added DoorDash's chief executive, Tony Xu, to its board of directors in January. The pandemic served as an unexpected boon for DoorDash, the nation's largest food-delivery service. The app expanded to delivering items including toothpaste to Tylenol, as spending on delivery surged. It also doubled down on logistics partnerships with retailers including Sephora and JCPenney. Under those partnerships, DoorDash uses its fleet of gig workers to deliver orders placed directly on other websites. Now DoorDash and rival Uber Eats are trying to build logistics businesses that sell speed and convenience, rather than just food. The delivery companies say powering next-hour delivery for consumers and businesses -- which includes delivering everything from drugstore staples and alcohol to clothes and cosmetics on demand -- is the prize that could sustain their growth. DoorDash's deal with Meta marks its first foray into ferrying goods between consumers. The companies had been discussing a partnership since at least 2021, according to one of the people familiar with Meta's plans. DoorDash approached Facebook about a partnership in part to create more work for its drivers, especially when drivers aren't busy delivering lunch and dinner, this person said. In a statement, DoorDash said it continuously explores and tests new innovations that focus on providing convenience. and Preetika Rana at preetika.rana@wsj.com 12 Aug 2022 Facebook Marketplace, DoorDash Team Up for Local Deliveries By Salvador Rodriguez and Preetika Rana Drivers for DoorDash Inc. are now delivering items to consumers purchased online from Facebook Marketplace as part of a new partnership between the delivery app and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc.

Marketplace is a feature within Facebook that lets people sell new and used goods to one another. Facebook has struggled to add younger users, who now prefer rival TikTok.

Meta_Facebook,"For Meta, a Cheap Stock Isn't Enough -- Barron's",5 February 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"2,121 words",0.9363,0.092,0.077,0.831,"9 English , Inc. A disappointing forecast shocked investors, who have grown used to reliable growth from Facebook, even amid controversy By Eric J. Savitz Suddenly, investors are giving Facebook a big thumbs down. Within 24 hours of reporting dismal results on Wednesday night, Facebook parent Meta Platforms lost more than a quarter of its market capitalization, some $250 billion. It was the largest single-day loss of corporate value in U.S. history. And the value destruction might not be over. For Facebook, this is different than the privacy scandals and political controversies that have surrounded the company. This time, the problems are with the business itself. Meta (ticker: FB) offered a first-quarter outlook that reveals slowing usage of its social media apps and troubling trends in advertising sales. Fixing the problems will take multiple quarters, and potentially years. Meanwhile, the repairs will have to be made as the company pivots to the metaverse, a significant gamble on an unproven technology. By the end of a long week of tech earnings (see this week's Tech Trader), it became clear that Meta's problems are unique, and not part of a broader industry downturn. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) posted strong results driven by demand for advertising space on Google Search and YouTube. And on Thursday afternoon -- one day after Meta's nightmarish report -- smaller rivals Snap (SNAP) and Pinterest (PINS) surprised investors with better-than-expected numbers, including Snap's first-ever profit. Amazon.com (AMZN) rounded out the big week of earnings with its own impressive results -- including 32% growth in its advertising business. Those reports helped tech stocks snap back on Friday: The Nasdaq Composite rallied 2%, but Meta shares were flat. The lack of buying on the dip reflects the serious issues Meta raised with its earnings. For the first quarter, the company sees revenue of $27 billion to $29 billion, up between 3% and 11% from a year ago. That would be a sharp deceleration from 48% growth a year ago. Meta said results would be affected by ""headwinds"" to both the number of ad impressions generated by its platforms and by pressures on ad pricing. The forecast came as a shock to Facebook investors who have grown used to reliable growth, even amid controversy. Meta by its own admission is now dealing with multiple issues: slowing usage of the company's core social media apps, tough earnings comparisons, decelerating spending by advertisers that are facing labor and product shortages, and intensified competition from TikTok, the short-form video app owned by China-based ByteDance. Meta's mention of weaker ad impressions was the real shocker. The company said its core Facebook business had one million fewer daily average users in the December quarter versus the previous three months. That has never happened before. The slowdown could reflect people spending more time out of the house after two years of severe pandemic restrictions. Alternatively, or perhaps additionally, it could be that people are simply growing a little tired of social media, and using the platforms a little less. On its post-earnings call with investors, Meta repeatedly pointed to competition from TikTok. Meta is going after TikTok with a competitive service called Reels, which have been pushed across Facebook feeds. But it is going to take time for Facebook to catch up to TikTok's popularity, if it ever does. Meanwhile, the issue is cutting into Meta's revenues. ""On the impressions side, we expect continued headwinds from both increased competition for people's time and a shift of engagement within our apps toward video surfaces like Reels, which monetize at lower rates than Feed and Stories,"" the company said. In other words, competition from TikTok is forcing Facebook to push users into less profitable parts of its platform. On ad pricing, meanwhile, Meta continues to deal with Apple's (AAPL) adoption of tough new rules that limit advertisers' ability to track consumer behavior on iOS devices. Those changes weren't yet in place a year ago, so the comparison will be felt again in the first quarter. ""We anticipate modestly increasing ad targeting and measurement headwinds from platform and regulatory changes,"" Meta said. The company has previously expressed confidence that it could develop workarounds for Apple's changes, which affect ad targeting along with knowing when ads trigger purchases or other consumer behaviors. But Meta now sounds less confident about a near-term fix, saying the Apple changes will trim its revenue by $10 billion this year. Perhaps most worrisome for Facebook is that Snap and Pinterest, rivals that in theory should be suffering a similar slowdown from Apple's changes, didn't report the same issues in the quarter. To be sure, the Meta story still has investor appeal, most notably a cheap stock. After the selloff, Meta trades at a discount to the S&P 500 -- 19.3 times versus 20.3 times, respectively. Meta has also been aggressively buying back stock -- $33 billion over the past two quarters. While those purchases look ill-timed, the buybacks suggest that the Meta board considers the stock cheap. That doesn't mean it can't get cheaper. Meta's risks are growing and they're no longer just about Facebook's legacy business. The company is spending aggressively on its metaverse build out -- capital spending this year is expected to be between $29 billion and $34 billion, up from $19.2 billion last year. No one really knows if the plan will work: How many people want to attend concerts, parties, and meetings in an imaginary world while wearing a virtual reality headset? The metaverse has become CEO Mark Zuckerberg's biggest bet -- and it gives the company a quickly changing risk profile, one that looks uncomfortable even with a cheap stock. Meta's user base is mammoth -- 3.6 billion monthly active users, or close to half the Earth's population. But growth is finally slowing, the advertising business is in trouble, regulators are circling, and the metaverse is in its infancy. For Meta, it's a mega set of risks.

Meta_Facebook,"EXCHANGE --- Keywords: Where Facebook Goes From Here --- Apple, regulators and fickle teens are just a few of Meta's problems; its pivot to the metaverse might not work out",11 June 2022,The Wall Street Journal,"1,959 words",0.4103,0.07,0.052,0.878,"It wasn't long ago that Facebook seemed to be riding high -- with its ad-driven money machine still humming and a valuation that, as recently as September, topped $1 trillion. Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, is today the poster child of the tech reckoning. And, more so than its fellow tech giants, Meta's fate in the long run is anyone's guess. Which makes it a good time to ponder how much longer its travails will last, and what it might look like on the other side. While the shares of all tech companies have been hammered lately, the underlying profit machines for Apple, Microsoft, Google and Amazon suggest that they will weather the current economic, regulatory, and other challenges. Meta, on the other hand, seems to be genuinely threatened in the near term by several factors that could hurt its revenue and reach. The first is aggressive regulation -- new and pending, from the Federal Trade Commission and the European Union, and perhaps even Congress. The second is the impact on its advertising model of Apple's privacy changes -- and the prospect that Google might be following Apple's example for its Android mobile operating system. The third is the rapid growth of TikTok, as well as a handful of other growing competitors that are siphoning away Facebook's youngest users and challenging it for the attention of its older ones. And the fourth is that Meta is making a huge bet -- to the tune of nearly $10 billion in R&D a year -- on building an entirely new business for itself, the metaverse, that might not pan out. It's not as if Meta's competitors aren't facing some of the same challenges -- Google, especially, is facing even more heat from regulators than Facebook. But no other company of its size is facing so many challenges at once. What this all means, in the parlance of futurists -- the kind who teach at universities and are employed by Fortune 500 companies -- is that the ""cone of possibility"" for Meta's future is unusually broad, compared with tech companies of comparable size. Exploring the range of possible outcomes for Meta matters a great deal, not just for its investors and the tens of millions of businesses that rely on the company's services to reach their customers, but also for the billions of people who use them. At one extreme of Meta's cone of possibility, the company continues to bleed users, attention and revenue. Then, the final insult, the metaverse it is betting its future on is built by Apple instead, and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's big pivot fails. Eventually, the company is absorbed by a rival, maybe ByteDance, TikTok's parent. (I realize this sounds highly improbable, but proper futuring is about considering all possibilities.) At the other extreme of all possible futures for Meta, and one that seems more likely, is that Meta manages to muddle through its pivot to become primarily a metaverse company, after all. Sure, it won't be perfect. After a dip in revenue, it might take many years for Meta to match what it was able to generate by manipulating its users into using Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp as much as possible, harvesting the resulting attention, and selling it to advertisers. The metaverse represents an opportunity for Facebook to make money in new ways that aren't primarily about advertising. Before we go more into Meta's future, a refresher on its present. In some ways, it's a grim picture. Apple's move last year to limit how smartphone data can be used to target ads has hammered Meta's core business model just as economic and geopolitical uncertainty have broadly hurt the digital-advertising sector. That all led to Meta's reporting revenue growth in the first quarter that was its slowest since its stock-market debut in 2012. Meta has estimated that the Apple change will cost it $10 billion in lost revenue in 2022 alone. Overall user growth for its family of apps has essentially plateaued, and daily users of its mainstay Facebook app actually declined in the final quarter of last year. Chief Financial Officer David Wehner recently suggested that user growth for that core ""blue"" app may be over, and that number will bounce around its current plateau of around two billion people from quarter to quarter. All that has driven its stock down by over half in the past nine months -- a far steeper decline than the tech sector broadly. And there is ample evidence that these headwinds will only intensify. Google has said it will roll out privacy changes similar to Apple's that could further reduce Meta's access to the personal data of approximately three of every four smartphone users in the world. Given that Apple's privacy changes have pushed ad delivery through Facebook toward Android devices, Google's changes could be especially troubling for Meta's future revenue. Meanwhile, TikTok is siphoning away young people, Meta's most valuable demographic -- and the one most important for its future. And yet a Pew survey found that in 2021 TikTok had less than a third of the U.S. users Facebook did. Collectively, these trends indicate that on both the revenue and user side, TikTok has both tremendous momentum and room to grow. Given the state of the U.S. economy, that revenue growth is likely to come at the expense of other digital media giants, especially Facebook. Against the backdrop of all this concerning news, it appears Meta's pivot to the metaverse, while already under way, won't be completed anytime soon. Mr. Zuckerberg has said the company's metaverse projects will be in the red for up to five years, and that some of the technology required to realize his vision could take 10 to 15 years. Because many of us have lived through the unprecedented rise of new technologies like the PC, the internet, and smartphones, we've grown accustomed to thinking that the gap between hearing about some new tech and having it in our hands is short. But that's generally not how big shifts to transformative new technologies work, says Andrew Bosworth, chief technology officer of Meta and head of its VR and metaverse-focused Reality Labs. Making a virtual- or augmented-reality system people are comfortable wearing for long periods, and which is ultimately no more cumbersome than a pair of eyeglasses, he adds, ""is as hard a problem as our industry has tackled in 60 years."" As part of its efforts to continue growing, Meta recently started distributing its AI engineers to product teams, rather than centralizing them all in a research lab. While AI is relevant to any number of things the company does, ad targeting remains important. Facebook's ability to micro-target ads depends not just on how much data the company can gather on us, but its ability to use AI to match us to other consumers like us. Other efforts by Meta include pushing advertisers to build shops within Instagram and Facebook. This effort is in its early days, and some retailers have complained about the results. Retail that happens within Meta's own sites and apps helps the company gather data its AI needs to target ads and complete sales, making up for data lost to device makers' privacy changes. Meta's costly investment in new virtual- and mixed-reality headsets -- that is, ones that combine VR and the real world -- will yield many new opportunities to gather data on us, and could even allow even more efficient ad targeting, says Amy Webb, an author, professor at NYU's Stern School of Business and a self-described ""quantitative futurist."" If people are using a Meta-built headset, the company can't be blocked by either Google or Apple from gathering all the user data the law allows. What's more, a headset -- which can do everything from recognizing our body language and posture to tracking our eyes and listening to our voice -- would grant Meta an unprecedented amount of information about not just where we are and what we're doing, but also our moment-to-moment emotional state, adds Ms. Webb. ""We are committed to notifying the users any time a new kind of data or sensor will be used,"" says Mr. Bosworth. With such information, Meta would be able to advertise to us in ways more subtle -- and potentially more sinister -- than anything we've yet experienced, says Philip Rosedale, founder of Linden Lab, the company that built the original metaverse, Second Life. ""In a metaverse, you don't know where the ads are anymore,"" says Mr. Rosedale. ""In the real world they're in squares, they're in rectangles, you can choose to ignore them. That's not true in a metaverse. The ad is that person across the street, who isn't necessarily a real person; they're an ad."" It's still early for the company in terms of determining how advertising might work in the metaverse, says Mr. Bosworth. He thinks the industry is ""getting ahead of itself"" by trying to figure this out now. In many of the same ways television advertising has proven so effective, ads that surround us and with which we might interact without even knowing it could be that much more effective. What's more, all the biometric data gathered by a headset could rapidly tell Meta's systems things like your sexual orientation and your mental-health status, and sell that information to an advertiser, adds Mr. Rosedale. Meta stopped allowing advertisers to explicitly target users by ""sensitive"" topics like sexual or political orientation in November 2021. But the company's powerful ""lookalike audiences"" feature uses AI to target people on Facebook who match the demographics, interests and behaviors of people an advertiser has already identified as among its target audience. As with advertising formats, Meta is also still early in its process of figuring out which kinds of data gathered by headsets are useful for targeting advertising, says Mr. Bosworth. It's not clear to him that unconscious behaviors are as valuable as conscious ones for that purpose, he adds. Beyond ads, there is early evidence Facebook is trying to figure out how to make money from the metaverse in other ways. For example, Meta recently said that it could charge content creators in its metaverse up to 47.5% of the sale price of virtual goods sold through its new sales platform, which it introduced in April. Mr. Bosworth took pains to distinguish between what the company charges for apps sold in its VR app store, where it takes a 30% cut, and what it charges for sales within its metaverse, which can be accessed through apps purchased from its VR store or elsewhere. So, for example, if someone accessed Meta's metaverse through a web browser or a mobile device instead of a Meta-built VR headset -- the ability to do so is forthcoming -- then something sold in its metaverse would only be subject to an in-metaverse 25% sales fee. Even if Apple wins the war for headset dominance, Meta still has ample opportunity to make money from its metaverse. Just as the iPhone supercharged Meta's growth back when it was called Facebook, a stylish and user-friendly VR or AR headset from Apple could prove to be the perfect delivery device for a metaverse-based social network brought to you by -- who else, really? -- Meta."
Meta_Facebook,Facebook and Instagram Messaging Functions Are Down -- Update,3 November 2021,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,295 words",-0.9855,0.023,0.063,0.915,"English , Inc. The messaging functions on Facebook and Instagram are suffering from an outage on Wednesday, according to a company spokeswoman. ""We're aware that some people are having trouble accessing Messenger, Workplace Chat and Instagram DMs. We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and we apologize for any inconvenience,"" a spokeswoman said. Workplace Chat is a tool for companies that lets workers communicate and collaborate with each other, akin to the enterprise functionality for Slack Technologies. The latest outage comes nearly a month after an hourslong global outage, which left billions of users unable to use Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. All four apps are owned by the newly renamed Meta Platforms Inc. The company was formerly known as Facebook Inc. Reports of outages started appearing around 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, according to Downdetector, a site that tracks website outages. Some users went to rival social-media site Twitter Inc. to complain about the outage. Meta took to Twitter, too. ""No, your wifi isn't out,"" said a tweet from Facebook Messenger's account. ""We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible. #messengerdown"" Instagram tweeted an apology with its own hashtag: #instagramdown. The Meta spokeswoman confirmed the authenticity of the tweets from the Messenger and Instagram accounts. Meta has 3.58 billion monthly users across Facebook, Instagram and its other services, according to the company's most recent earnings report. The latest outage follows Facebook's announced name change last week, in which it is trying to position itself beyond its namesake social-media platform and instead focus on the metaverse, a virtual world that the company sees as a key growth area that can also attract younger users. Rebranding itself as Meta comes as Facebook faces intense criticism from lawmakers, researchers and users over revelations in The Wall Street Journal's Facebook Files series. The Journal's articles have exposed how the social-media company knew its platforms were riddled with flaws that cause harm, and that the company didn't fix those flaws. Mark Zuckerberg has said the criticism paints a false picture of the company he co-founded. 3 Nov 2021 Facebook and Instagram Messaging Functions Back Up After Outage By Joseph Pisani The messaging functions on Facebook and Instagram suffered an hourslong outage Wednesday afternoon before appearing to come back online, the third disruption to Meta Platforms Inc. products in a month.

Meta_Facebook,Technology,14 February 2022,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,223 words",0.2273,0.061,0.061,0.879,"The Texas attorney general filed a suit against Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. on Monday, charging that the social-media giant's longstanding and now discontinued use of facial-recognition technology violated that state's privacy protections for personal biometric data. The lawsuit, filed in state district court in Marshall by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, seeks civil penalties in the hundreds of billions of dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter. In a statement, Mr. Paxton said the company's capture of facial geometry in photographs that users uploaded from 2010 to late last year resulted in ""tens of millions of violations"" of Texas law. ""Facebook has been secretly harvesting Texans' most personal information—photos and videos—for its own corporate profit,"" Mr. Paxton said. ""Texas law has prohibited such harvesting without informed consent for over 20 years. While ordinary Texans have been using Facebook to innocently share photos of loved ones with friends and family, we now know that Facebook has been brazenly ignoring Texas law for the last decade."" In a statement, Meta said the claims against Facebook ""are without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously."" Meta says that before it decided to shut down its facial recognition system, users were always provided with notice and an opportunity to consent when they used those services. Facebook previously settled another lawsuit over its facial-recognition practices for about $650 million. That class-action suit filed in 2015 was brought under Illinois's biometric privacy law, which is similar in some respects to the Texas law. Both laws require individuals' consent before their biometric identifiers can be captured . In the class-action case, Facebook's lawyers said the Illinois law didn't apply to its method for identifying users in photos. The company also said it had given users the ability to opt out of the feature. Facebook's efforts to dismiss the class-action case were unsuccessful, and the company settled the case in 2020. The Texas lawsuit—in particular the size of the civil penalties being sought—points to the impact that increasingly widespread privacy laws could have on big tech companies' operations. The case shows that ""states and individuals have a major role to play in privacy protection,"" said John Davisson, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research and advocacy group. ""We can't count on Congress and even the FTC [Federal Trade Commission] to be on top of every data abuse,"" Mr. Davisson said. ""It's important that there be other avenues."" After Facebook's settlement of the Illinois class-action case became known, Texas sent its own civil subpoena to the company seeking information about the facial-recognition system. Facebook announced it was ending its facial recognition system last November. ""These procedural protections are particularly crucial in our digital world because technology now permits the wholesale collection and storage of an individual's unique biometric identifiers—identifiers that cannot be changed if compromised or misused,"" U.S. District Judge James Donato wrote in the class-action case. ""When an online service simply disregards the Illinois procedures, as Facebook is alleged to have done, the right of the individual to maintain her biometric privacy vanishes into thin air."" Texas says Facebook's facial-recognition system ignored that state's legal requirements for capturing users' facial features. ""For over a decade, while holding itself out as a trusted meeting place for Texans to connect and share special moments with family and friends, Facebook was secretly capturing, disclosing, unlawfully retaining—and profiting off of—Texans' most personal and highly sensitive information: records of their facial geometries, which Texas law refers to as biometric identifiers,"" the state argues in the complaint. The Texas law makes it unlawful to capture people's biometric identifiers without their informed consent and prohibits sharing that information. Unlike the Illinois law that led to the class-action suit, the Texas law can only be enforced by the state's attorney general. The Texas law also provides for a penalty of $25,000 per violation. The complaint estimates that at least 20 million Texans were members of Facebook in 2021. The civil subpoena issued by Texas demanded all the materials that Facebook had produced in response to the class-action lawsuit. Facebook's announcement that it would stop using its facial-recognition system cited public concern over the technology. ""We're shutting down the Face Recognition system on Facebook,"" the company said in a blog post, explaining that it would ""delete more than a billion people's individual facial recognition templates."" It said that ""the many specific instances where facial recognition can be helpful need to be weighed against growing concerns about the use of this technology as a whole."" Texas officials say in their suit that they are seeking to recover civil penalties for past violations of the law and that they would try to stop any future improper uses—suggesting Meta might still retain some of the facial-recognition data it collected. ""Facebook announced, in November 2021, that it would cease use of the face-recognition feature on its Facebook social-media platform,"" the complaint says. ""Facebook has made no such commitment with respect to any of the other platforms or operations under its corporate umbrella, such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Reality Labs, or its upcoming virtual-reality metaverse."" In a blog post announcing that it was ending its use of facial recognition, Facebook said that it would ""continue working on these technologies and engaging outside experts…[But] amid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate."" The Texas suit also says Facebook has obtained patents for systems ""where consumers wandering in stores or standing at checkout counters have their faces scanned and matched with their social-networking profiles."" Mr. Paxton brought in two outside companies—Keller Lenkner LLC and McKool Smith P.C.—to help out because the case against Meta is complex and raises technical issues, he said. The case was filed in state court in Marshall because it has become a popular choice for technology litigation, he added. The Texas investigation itself might have slowed at least some of the facial-recognition system's shutdown. Following the company's announcement in early November, Texas authorities demanded that relevant data be preserved while the state investigated. In a follow-up letter on Nov. 10, Texas officials said Facebook had confirmed that Meta ""will not delete any source code related to Facebook's Facial Recognition system,"" and would ""preserve all metadata related to the system"" including data sufficient to identify Texas users, which users had facial recognition enabled, and which users had face templates saved. Facebook said it believed the face templates themselves weren't material and could be deleted, according to the Nov. 10 letter from the Texas attorney general's office. The attorney general's office expressed concern about that, and demanded that Meta not delete any face template information for past or present Texas residents.

Meta_Facebook,Meta Sued Over Scam Ads Shown On Facebook -- WSJ,19 March 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,822 words,-0.9925,0.047,0.108,0.845,"B1 English , Inc. An Australian regulator is suing Meta Platforms Inc., accusing it of not doing enough to remove scam ads from Facebook that featured public figures promoting cryptocurrency, deepening the social media giant's legal troubles over the issue. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission alleged in federal court that the scam ads were still being displayed on Facebook even after public figures around the world complained that their names and images were being used without consent. One of them, Andrew Forrest, the chairman and largest shareholder of major iron ore producer Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., has filed litigation against Meta in Australian and American courts over similar fake ads. Meta said it has cooperated with the regulator's investigation so far and intends to defend itself in court. The company says it uses technology to detect and block scam ads and tries to get ahead of scammers' attempts to evade its detection systems. ""We don't want ads seeking to scam people out of money or mislead people on Facebook,"" a spokesperson said. ""They violate our policies and are not good for our community."" According to the Australian regulator, the ads had links that took Facebook users to a fake media article that included quotes from public figures endorsing a cryptocurrency or other moneymaking venture. Users were invited to sign up and subsequently pressured by scammers to deposit funds into the fake schemes, the regulator said. The ads included well-known Australians like businessman Dick Smith, television presenter David Koch and politician Mike Baird, the regulator said. The regulator said Meta's technology enabled the fake ads to target the users who were most likely to engage with them. When a user clicks the link in an ad and visits the ad's landing page, those visits generate substantial revenue for Facebook, the regulator said. In one instance, a person lost more than $450,000 due to a falsely advertised investment opportunity on Facebook, the regulator said. ""Meta should have been doing more to detect and then remove false or misleading ads on Facebook, to prevent consumers from falling victim to ruthless scammers,"" commission Chair Rod Sims said. ""The essence of our case is that Meta is responsible for these ads that it publishes on its platform."" Meta could face millions of dollars in penalties if a court finds the company breached Australian consumer laws. Meta has a review process to make sure ads that appear on Facebook comply with its advertising policies, the company has said. The review is largely automated, but it relies on employees to build and train the systems and in some cases ads are manually reviewed. Meta has taken legal action against organizations or individuals who are responsible for similar scam ads. In 2020, Meta said one defendant provided so-called cloaking software and services designed to circumvent automated ad review systems. When ads are cloaked, an ad review system may see a website showing an everyday product, but a user will see a different website that promotes deceptive products and services, Meta said at the time. Other public figures have had legal tussles with Facebook over scam ads. In early 2019, Facebook said it would donate $3.3 million to a project to fight scam ads in connection with the settlement of a lawsuit from Martin Lewis, a U.K. TV personality and the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, a consumer-finance website. He sued the social media company for defamation over scam ads that used his name and image. Meta has faced increased regulatory scrutiny all over the world after The Wall Street Journal published a series of articles, called The Facebook Files, that revealed harm caused by the social media company's platforms and its challenges in addressing those issues. Even before those articles were published, Australia had taken an aggressive stance in seeking to regulate big tech companies. Early last year, Australia's parliament passed legislation that effectively requires the likes of Facebook and Google parent Alphabet Inc. to pay news publishers for content, a move that was watched by lawmakers in other countries. More recently, Australia said it would introduce legislation to make social-media companies liable for defamatory comments published on their platforms, a move that risks exposing tech companies to lawsuits. It is also considering new data-privacy rules that could make it illegal for social media companies to direct children to harmful content. News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Facebook. --Stuart Condie contributed to this article.

Meta_Facebook,A-hed,23 May 2022,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,145 words",0.0556,0.075,0.069,0.856,"You thought you had to wait forever to speak with a customer service representative? Facebook and Instagram serve nearly 3 billion users a day with a help desk that numbers closer to zero. So pity John Bacon, a 72-year-old retiree of Cleveland, Ohio. Facebook disabled his account after it was hacked last year, and he expected to speak with someone about getting it up and running. Mr. Bacon hunted for a customer help line or an email address and learned what many others before him have discovered: There are none. ""I have never been able to speak to a human,"" he said of what turned out to be a monthslong quest to restore his Facebook account. Users of the free services in the empire of Meta Platforms Inc., which includes WhatsApp, sometimes go to great and unusual lengths to get help. Few succeed. Customer service at TikTok and Twitter is about the same. Some Twitter users hope Elon Musk's purchase of the company will help. ""I beg you to please look at customer service,"" one user recently tweeted at Mr. Musk, saying he had to send a letter to Twitter headquarters via FedEx for a minor problem. Mr. Bacon said he patiently followed Facebook's instructions. He changed his password, twice, and provided identification. Nothing happened. Then he pleaded help from a higher power. He sent a certified letter to Sheryl Sandberg, Meta's chief operating officer, at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. He described his failed efforts to resurrect his Facebook page. ""No path exists for me to address the issue,"" Mr. Bacon wrote. He signed the letter, with warm regards. Ms. Sandberg didn't write back. Meta spokesman Joe Osborne declined to comment on specific user experiences but acknowledged that losing an account can be distressing and that the company needs to improve. Some Meta customers have been temporarily shut out of their accounts following decisions by the social media giant's algorithms, or human moderators f or reasons that users often find baffling (""https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-facebook-jail-trump-the-secret-rules-that-put-users-in-the-doghouse-11620138445""). More recently, people said in interviews that, like Mr. Bacon, their Facebook accounts were disabled after they got hacked. They also said getting help was impossible. Some frustrated users have turned to IT charlatans who tout their expertise in restoring Facebook accounts. Hundreds of dollars later, users say it was money wasted. A woman in a widely viewed video of a podcast posted on Twitter last week claimed she slept with several Instagram employees to get her account back. Mr. Osborne declined to comment on the incident. Other people have sent messages begging for assistance from random Facebook or Instagram employees and executives listed on LinkedIn. Facebook locked Amber O'Sullivan's mom out of her account this year without an explanation. Ms. O'Sullivan turned to LinkedIn and messaged nearly two dozen Facebook employees in Ireland, where the family lives. ""Thierry"" responded, Ms. O'Sullivan said. He steered her to a news story about a live chat function Facebook was testing but didn't say how to find it. ""When I asked for more help, he sent me the same article on a different website,"" she said. Her mom's account was later unlocked without explanation. In March, Facebook introduced Facebook Protect, which it said added another layer of security to some accounts. Some users said the new feature instead blocked them from accessing Facebook. Thousands turned to JustAnswer, a website that connects people with experts in various industries. Facebook headquarters is in Menlo Park, Calif. PHOTO: Ian Bates for The Wall Street Journal Soon after Facebook Protect was rolled out, JustAnswer said Facebook-related inquiries jumped 88% over a week. The site gets an average of about 3,000 questions a day regarding Facebook and Instagram troubles. ""People are overwhelmed, and they don't understand what's happened,"" said Cris Angulo, a tech expert at JustAnswer. ""They just want to hear someone's voice. Sometimes they think we are Facebook."" When Mr. Angulo and his colleagues can't solve a problem, they steer people back to Facebook's online directions. Meta hasn't expanded its customer service to accommodate its billions of users because of the enormous scale and expense of the undertaking, according to people familiar with the company. It also has viewed a call center as its own security risk, a potential path for bad actors to gain access to accounts for criminal or other nefarious purposes. The company said it has made some customer-service investments, including testing a live-chat option for some users locked out of their accounts, and it also fixed software bugs that had made it hard for people to regain access. Facebook and Instagram employees said they used to have an internal process for getting help. That avenue is now largely closed, some of them said. When The Wall Street Journal wrote about Facebook's confusing platform rules last year, a Facebook spokeswoman said the company planned to ""build out better customer support."" In December, the company began what it said was a small test of its live online chat function. A recent job posting for head of customer support operations at Meta said addressing customer service was ""a complex problem, and we are just 1% finished."" A Reddit post suggested that people locked out of their Facebook accounts seek help from Andrew Burger, an employment lawyer based in Andover, Mass. He had sent certified letters to Facebook for three clients, charging $250 each. ""I always overnight them, to make them seem important,"" he said. Facebook didn't write back. One of Mr. Burger's letters, on behalf of an online influencer, said that because his client couldn't access her Facebook account, she had moved to TikTok, a competing social-media platform. His client's account was restored 12 hours after the letter arrived, he said. One idea that spread last year on Reddit and Quora involved buying a roughly $300 Oculus virtual-reality headset. Oculus, which is owned by Meta, has a dedicated customer-service line for the devices. Mr. Bacon said he learned about it from his wife, who heard something on National Public Radio. After his letter to Ms. Sandberg went unanswered, Mr. Bacon in December bought one of the headsets, which have been rebranded as Meta Quest. Two hours after speaking with someone in Oculus customer service, his Facebook account was restored. The headset, having done its work, is also retired.

Meta_Facebook,Business News: Facebook's E-Commerce Bet Stumbles --- Some frustrated retailers say the service is missing basic components,4 May 2022,The Wall Street Journal,963 words,0.987,0.076,0.025,0.899,"Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. developed e-commerce services in 2020 as people shopped more from home and the company faced a changing digital ad market. Two years later, employees, former executives and retailers say the division remains a work in progress. Some retailers say they are frustrated by Meta's e-commerce rollout, noting that the service is missing basic components such as the ability to display products in different colors and sizes if they aren't sold directly through Facebook and Instagram, limit where a merchant can ship items and provide next-day or same-day deliveries. Other stores, though, see the promise of connecting with shoppers through the large user bases of Facebook and Instagram. At least five senior executives have left in the past six months, according to a former senior executive in the division. Facebook is confident in its e-commerce business. ""Building a full-fledged commerce platform is a multiyear journey -- one that became a company priority less than two years ago,"" said Joe Osborne, a spokesperson for Meta. ""We're proud of our progress and in the teams working to build out these experiences."" Meta began ramping up its efforts in e-commerce during the early days of the pandemic, launching features called Facebook and Instagram Shops in May 2020. The shops let brands post their catalogs directly on Facebook and Instagram. Some brands use the shops to direct users to purchase on their websites while others choose to sell the items to users via Meta's services. Meta also started bracing for the impact of privacy changes Apple Inc. announced in June 2020 for its iPhone and iPad devices. Those changes, which rolled out in April 2021, allowed users to opt out of having their activity on their devices tracked by companies like Meta. That tracking data was critical to how Meta measures the effectiveness of advertisements. The loss of that data drove advertisers elsewhere, putting a major dent in the company's earnings for the past two quarters. Since February, when Meta posted disappointing user growth and revenue and said Apple's new policy would cost more than $10 billion in lost sales for 2022, the company's shares have dropped more than 34%. That is equivalent to a loss of $307.8 billion in market value. About 97% of Meta's revenue comes from advertising, according to its first-quarter results. Meta also said it would be spending more as the company pivots to the metaverse, a virtual world where people work, play and interact. Online shopping offers a way to ease the impact from the Apple changes. By developing channels of commerce within its apps, Meta can measure the effectiveness of ads within its own services and reclaim some of the data it lost. The potential is significant: Amazon.com Inc., which dominates in e-commerce, reported $7.88 billion in ad sales in its most recent quarter, a 23% increase from the same period a year ago. Meta doesn't break out results from its shopping business, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last week that the company recently saw a pullback in e-commerce usage. Other online retailers, like Amazon, have also talked about an e-commerce slowdown as more Covid-19 restrictions are lifted and people return to in-person shopping in recent months. Among commerce's most notable departures are Vice President of Commerce Business and Operations Gene Alston, who announced in Meta's Workplace recently that he would be leaving the company, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Alston had been responsible for all strategy and teams for commerce products across Meta's family of apps. Roi Tiger, vice president of engineering for commerce across the company, also announced his departure on Workplace, according to a person familiar with the matter. Eddie Garcia, who previously served as chief product officer for Sam's Club and was brought in last June to run the company's Marketplace feature, left the company in March. Chris Olaniran is a user who wanted to create an Instagram Shop for his clothing brand, Vital Clothing. That process required setups on both Facebook and Instagram, and in Mr. Olaniran's case, on Shopify Inc., a Canadian e-commerce company that he uses to host his online store. ""This is where I first realized, OK, this is a lot more complicated than I thought,"" he said. After making the necessary changes to both his Instagram and Facebook accounts, linking them to his product catalog in Shopify and getting approval to sell, Mr. Olaniran struggled to get all of his items to appear in the shop. He said he never figured out how to get changes to his product catalog to show up. ""You would think that there would be some sort of accessible method of support, but after trying to solve the issue myself, it really became apparent that it's really the exact opposite,"" he said. Meta said businesses can get support in a number of ways and pointed to an online help center. Mr. Olaniran eventually abandoned the idea of having an Instagram Shop. Meta recently began showing a promotion to Instagram users, offering them 20% off when they make their first e-commerce order through the social network. More notably, the company is set to expand the availability of ads within the Facebook and Instagram Shops feature, a format it announced in June 2021, in which ads send users to curated collections from a shop or a business's website. There are approximately 200 sellers doing early testing of Shops ads, according to a Meta employee."
Meta_Facebook,Facebook Parent Meta Ordered to Sell Giphy After Losing Fight in U.K. -- WSJ,18 October 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,193 words",0.9802,0.074,0.029,0.897,"English , Inc. The U.K.'s top competition authority said that Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. must sell social-media animated-images company Giphy, affirming an earlier ruling that its 2020 acquisition of the company could limit competition. The ruling all but ends a yearslong saga in which a foreign regulator made a rare intervention in an already-consummated deal between two American companies. British regulators had ordered Meta to operate Giphy separately while the deal was under review. Meta, then known as Facebook, bought Giphy in May 2020 for $315 million. The company, with offices in New York City and Los Angeles, allows users to search for, create and share short animated videos, or GIFs, which have become popular in social-media posts, texts and other communications. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority initially ordered Meta to sell Giphy last year. Meta appealed the decision. In July, the Competition Appeal Tribunal backed the CMA in five out of six challenges to the CMA ruling. On Tuesday, after taking that ruling into consideration, the CMA issued a revised decision that again ordered Meta to sell Giphy. Meta said that it is disappointed by the order, but it won't appeal the decision further. The company says it will work with the CMA to sell Giphy, and is awaiting more details in the coming weeks from the regulator about how it should do so. The decision comes as the CMA is asserting itself on the global stage as a technology regulator -- opening antitrust cases against tech companies alongside others stemming from the U.S. and European Union. The CMA has open cases looking at issues including how Alphabet Inc.'s Google brokers ads on third-party websites, and the control the regulator says Apple Inc. and Google exercise over mobile-phone software. The companies say they comply with competition rules and are working with the regulator. Meta's acquisition of Giphy ""would significantly reduce competition in two markets,"" said Stuart McIntosh, the chairman of the investigative team appointed by the CMA to review the deal. By buying Giphy, Mr. McIntosh said Facebook had removed a ""potential challenger in the U.K. display ad market, while also giving Meta the ability to further increase its substantial market power in social media."" A sale of Giphy is the only way to address the issue, he said. Meta had said in the past that consumers and Giphy are better off with the infrastructure and resources Meta can provide. The company said at the time of the deal that it would integrate Giphy into its Instagram platform. The CMA began probing Meta's Giphy deal soon after it was announced. Last fall, it fined Meta 50.5 million pounds, or $57.2 million, saying the company had failed to provide required updates outlining its compliance with the initial enforcement order in relation to the merger review. Meta at the time disputed the fine for what the company called a ""best effort compliance approach."" The move by the CMA isn't an unprecedented one. In April 2020, it blocked Sabre Corp.'s tie-up with rival travel booking service Farelogix Inc., saying it was anticompetitive. The regulator said the deal could have reduced innovation in the sector and led to higher fees for certain products. and Sam Schechner at Sam.Schechner@wsj.com 18 Oct 2022 Facebook Parent Meta Ordered to Sell Giphy After Losing Fight in U.K. By Ian Walker and Sam Schechner Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. said it would sell its social-media animated-images company Giphy after the U.K.'s top competition authority affirmed an earlier ruling that the 2020 acquisition could limit competition.

Meta_Facebook,"META, A REVOLUTIONARY SMALL BUSINESS, FILES LAWSUIT AGAINST META PLATFORMS (F/K/A FACEBOOK)",19 July 2022,PR Newswire,"1,036 words",0.9869,0.109,0.067,0.824,"English Copyright © 2022 PR Newswire Association LLC.  Founded in 2010, the Original META has Pioneered the Immersive and Experiential Technology Industry, Holding Broad Trademark Rights That META Alleges Tech-Giant Facebook has Willfully and Blatantly Violated Since Late 2021 NEW YORK, July 19, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- META, a small business operating in the immersive and experiential technology industry since 2010, today filed a lawsuit against Facebook. For 12 years, META has powered the types of experiences and products that Facebook is now building and has served the same creators and consumers that Facebook is now targeting. META's lawsuit, filed by Pryor Cashman LLP, alleges that Facebook unlawfully seized the META mark and name -- willfully violating META's trademark rights and engaging in egregious acts of unfair competition. ""META has spent 12 years supporting, developing, and protecting the creator community, creators' rights, and ironically, creators' intellectual property. Facebook's actions, illegally usurping our name and mark, have not only put our business in jeopardy, but that of the entire industry and the intellectual property rights of the innovators that have helped build it,"" said Justin ""JB"" Bolognino, META's Founder & CEO. ""Since Facebook's name change in late 2021, META has made good faith efforts to resolve this situation, but for eight months Facebook has refused to accept responsibility for its unlawful actions, leaving us no choice but to proceed with litigation."" META's Business META has a significant historical and present involvement in the creation and development of real-world and virtual social communities associated with the industry, as well as in fighting for the intellectual property rights, attribution, and financial interests of creators. META has also created, curated, and conducted revolutionary immersive experiences at some of the world's largest events -- including SXSW, Coachella and Cannes Lions. META's Lawsuit META's complaint alleges that Facebook is now doing exactly what META has done for over a decade under the META name and mark -- conducting the same immersive experiences, at the same events and venues, and working with the same creators and same companies. As a result of Facebook's actions, consumers are likely to mistakenly believe that META's products and services emanate from Facebook or that META is affiliated with Facebook. The META mark is now infected by the toxicity that is inextricably linked with Facebook. ""Not only has Facebook taken aim at our small business but also our reputation, which we have devoted our lives to building over the last decade. Facebook's rebrand and total disregard for our legal rights creates great concern for us and for the community of individuals, artists, industry and luminaries who META has championed and collaborated with for years,"" said Bolognino. ""Facebook acts like it can freely destroy the communities META has helped develop, overrun the industry, and obliterate META's business. But today, META is taking a stand against Facebook's flagrant and unlawful conduct."" ""Facebook has deployed its almost limitless resources to saturate the marketplace with its infringing META mark. This is textbook reverse confusion, which has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, significant and irreparable harm to META. Facebook cannot be allowed to continue its infringing conduct with impunity,"" said Dyan Finguerra-DuCharme, META's lead attorney and partner at Pryor Cashman LLP. META's History Bolognino, one of the pioneers of the immersive and experiential technology industry, founded META in 2010. Since then, he has worked with some of the world's leading companies, institutions, and creators, and built META into a pillar of the immersive and experiential technology industry. Bolognino has also acted as a guardian of the creator communities associated with the industry -- ensuring they are appropriately recognized, nurtured, and compensated for their extraordinary work. In 2016, Bolognino joined forces with Nick Sciorra, an advanced media-technology strategist and IP attorney, now META's Chief Strategy Officer. Together, they intensified META's focus on specializing in technology, design, storytelling, and immersive experiences, both virtually and in reality, coining this as ""The Art of Being There."" META has since partnered with brand clients including Spotify, Twitter, HP, Microsoft, and Google, and has championed a diverse range of digital and immersive artists from Beeple, Android Jones, Emily Baltz and VolvoxLabs to Softlab, SuperUber, and Dirt Empire, as well as musical collaborators such as St. Vincent, Skrillex, Porter Robinson, Troye Sivan, and Tiesto. More recently, and well before Facebook's name change, Bolognino and Sciorra furthered their pursuit of protecting creators and igniting the power of their uniquely diverse vision for a shared creator economy, by developing UNREALITY powered by META -- a social network platform and marketplace tailored to creator communities. In line with their long-standing beliefs, the pair have developed strategies to build supportive tokenized creator grants for immersive and NFT artists and studios. Bolognino and Sciorra believe creators should have sovereignty and creative controls within the marketplace, and have their intellectual property rights vehemently protected. This lawsuit is further evidence of Bolognino's, Sciorra's and META's determination to fight for the intellectual property rights of all those in the industry and for all small businesses being engulfed by corporate goliaths.

Meta_Facebook,Politics and Policy,7 March 2022,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,423 words",0.9926,0.097,0.033,0.87,"Corrections & Amplifications The America250 Foundation was created to support the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that the commission was created to support the foundation. (Corrected on March 8) The America250 Foundation's contract with Meta Platforms entitles Facebook to use America250 branding and to help plan and present the Semiquincentennial commemorations. PHOTO: Constanza Hevia H. for The Wall Street Journal WASHINGTON—The America250 Foundation, a nonprofit planning the government's observance of the American Revolution's 250th anniversary, has signed a deal with Meta Platforms Inc. giving Facebook's parent an inside role in producing and promoting the Semiquincentennial commemoration in exchange for $10 million, according to documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by the company. The agreement was approved by Daniel DiLella, a Pennsylvania real-estate executive who is chairman of both the foundation and the federal agency it was created to support, the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission. Both entities share a website and together present themselves as America250. The deal was made over objections from staff members, people familiar with the matter said, who argued it gave Facebook too much influence over a government project and provided special access and privileges that could deter other companies from joining as sponsors. The details haven't been disclosed to the full 36-member commission, which Congress established in 2016 to organize observances leading up to July 4, 2026, these people said. ""According to the policies and procedures of the commission, any contracts that include the use of the commission's logo, brand, or identity require the vote of the commission. No such vote has ever been presented or taken regarding this contract,"" said Commissioner Andrew Hohns, chief executive of Philadelphia investment firm Newmarket Capital, in an interview. Mr. DiLella declined interview requests On Wednesday, the commission is scheduled to vote on a package of proposals backed by Mr. DiLella that would provide blanket approval of previous actions the foundation has taken without explicit authority from the federal agency. Other provisions would give Mr. DiLella stronger control over the commission, with power to appoint officers and committee members, limit commissioners' participation in meetings and withhold information from both the public and other commissioners, the proposal says. The proposals are intended to streamline commission operations because there has been difficulty assembling a quorum, the introduction says. It adds that the commission's September meeting, where Mr. Hohns and two other commissioners asked for an accounting of public funds, was marred by ""a lack of decorum and respect for fellow Commissioners."" ""The Governance Committee spent more than 100 hours, including 14 hours in meetings deliberating on comments and suggestions,"" to improve commission procedures, America250 spokesman Michael Frazier said in a statement. The committee members either declined to comment or didn't respond to interview requests. If approved, the package could buttress Mr. DiLella's hold on a project that dissenting commissioners and a lawsuit by former employees claim has been undermined by mismanagement, favoritism and sex discrimination. Mr. Frazier said Mr. DiLella is ""committed to engaging an independent investigator to review these claims"" and hoped to begin a review within 30 days. Mr. Frazier released a statement Sunday saying that America250 followed ""a standard approach"" with the Facebook sponsorship and that the commission's development and executive committees ""were informed during the process. In addition, the full Commission has been informed of this potential corporate sponsorship as well. A larger public announcement has been pending."" Facebook said it was reviewing its association with America250 after The Wall Street Journal reported in February that four female executives had resigned in protest from the organization over what they called a toxic workplace and a coverup of improper expenditures and invoices by a vice president, among other complaints . ""We understood this to be a standard corporate sponsorship aimed at celebrating America's 250th anniversary, which is why we agreed to participate and support,"" a Meta spokesman said. ""We're reviewing this report and evaluating our participation."" The governance proposals come in the aftermath of the commission's contentious meeting in September, during which three members challenged Mr. DiLella's leadership. ""We think it is time for Congress to conduct oversight hearings on the management, hiring, contracting, and financial practices of the Commission and the Foundation, and on how the Commission has spent its federal appropriation,"" $20 million so far, Commissioner James Swanson, an author and former Republican Justice Department official, said at the September meeting, according to a transcript. Some commissioners say they are troubled by Mr. DiLella's latest plans. ""I would not be comfortable with rubber stamping everything that has been done over the past three years,"" former Rep. Joseph Crowley (D., N.Y.), who held a commission seat reserved for lawmakers until leaving Congress in 2019 and was reappointed in October 2021 as a private citizen, said in an interview. The America250 Foundation was created, in part, to marshal private-sector support for the Semiquincentennial. According to an internal finance report that was viewed by the Journal, as of December the foundation primarily was funded by the commission it is intended to support, which had transferred $11.8 million of its congressional appropriations to the nonprofit. The second-highest revenue source was $2 million contributed by an unnamed ""national sponsor."" That sponsor is Facebook, which pledged to pay the foundation $10 million in installments under an agreement signed in June by Scott Hommel, America250's chief operating officer then serving as interim chief executive, and Josh Ginsberg, Meta's vice president for public affairs marketing, the documents show. The contract makes Facebook the Semiquincentennial's exclusive ""social connectivity"" partner, entitled to use America250 branding and to help plan and present the commemorations. It provides Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg a seat on a Semiquincentennial Corporate Leadership Council. The agreement says ""America250 will support Facebook's efforts to catalog National Parks and Landmarks."" People familiar with the arrangement say that clause refers to Meta's virtual-reality product Oculus, which wants to capture images by flying drones over federal property. Meta has asked America250 to arrange meetings with Interior Department officials regarding the matter, these people say. The deal envisions outsourcing some Semiquincentennial observances to Meta. ""Programs and platforms will be detailed to Facebook, and may include vetted influencers and content on each subject designed to encourage discourse among Facebook users,"" it states. The arrangement was brokered by 21 Sports and Entertainment Marketing Group Inc., which receives a 17% commission. The Greenwich, Conn., firm already has received $340,000, the internal finance report says. Anna Laymon, then vice president of programs and planning for America250, took issue with the deal at a June meeting, according to an audio file of the meeting heard by the Journal. ""This seems to me to give Facebook special access to a federal agency,"" she said. Rob Prazmark, a 21 Marketing principal, said in the recording that the arrangement had been approved by Thomas McGarrigle, a friend of Mr. DiLella who is serving as the foundation's counsel. Mr. Prazmark declined to comment. Mr. McGarrigle didn't respond to an interview request. Ms. Laymon, who resigned in September, is a plaintiff in the lawsuit. At a September meeting where America250 executives discussed strategies for recruiting Walmart Inc. as a sponsor, Renee Burchard, then chief administrative officer and chief of staff, warned that Facebook's involvement could be a deal breaker for other companies. ""They're getting some bad, bad press,"" Ms. Burchard said, and ""congressional hearings"" on the company were under way. She cited Journal articles which last year documented social harms linked to Meta products such as Facebook and Instagram. Corporate sponsors want ""a safe, pure, nonpolitical, great place"" to enhance their brands, Ms. Burchard said. ""Facebook would make me go, 'Uh, hold on a minute.'"" ""I think Facebook's a monster. And in a good way,"" countered Thomas Shepard, another 21 Marketing executive. Mr. Shepard didn't respond to an interview request. Ms. Burchard resigned in December and is a plaintiff in the lawsuit. According to people familiar with the discussions, Walmart and several other companies have so far declined sponsorship invitations.

(Nope.) --- Users with account problems go to extreme lengths to seek customer service,24 May 2022,The Wall Street Journal,947 words,0.9412,0.083,0.061,0.856,"You thought you had to wait forever to speak with a customer service representative? Facebook and Instagram serve nearly 3 billion users a day with a help desk numbering closer to zero. So pity John Bacon, a 72-year-old retiree of Cleveland, Ohio. Facebook disabled his account after it was hacked last year, and he expected to speak with someone about getting it up and running. Mr. Bacon hunted for a customer help line or an email address and learned what many others before him have discovered: There are none. ""I have never been able to speak to a human,"" he said of what turned out to be a monthslong quest to restore his Facebook account. Users of the free services in the empire of Meta Platforms Inc., which includes WhatsApp, sometimes go to great and unusual lengths to get help. Few succeed. Customer service at TikTok and Twitter is about the same. Mr. Bacon said he patiently followed Facebook's instructions. He changed his password, twice, and provided identification. Nothing happened. Then he pleaded help from a higher power. He sent a certified letter to Sheryl Sandberg, Meta's chief operating officer, at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. He described failed efforts to resurrect his Facebook page. ""No path exists for me to address the issue,"" Mr. Bacon wrote. He signed the letter, with warm regards. Ms. Sandberg didn't write back. Meta spokesman Joe Osborne declined to comment on specific user experiences but acknowledged that losing an account can be distressing and that the company needs to improve. Some Meta customers have been temporarily shut out of their accounts following decisions by the social media giant's algorithms, or human moderators for reasons that users often find baffling. More recently, people said in interviews that, like Mr. Bacon, their Facebook accounts were disabled after they got hacked. They also said getting help was impossible. Some frustrated users have turned to IT charlatans who tout their expertise in restoring Facebook accounts. Hundreds of dollars later, users say it was money wasted. A woman in a widely viewed video of a podcast posted on Twitter last week claimed she slept with several Instagram employees to get her account back. Mr. Osborne declined to comment on the incident. Other people have sent messages begging for assistance from random Facebook or Instagram employees and executives via LinkedIn. Facebook locked Amber O'Sullivan's mom out of her account this year. Ms. O'Sullivan turned to LinkedIn and messaged nearly two dozen Facebook employees in Ireland, where the family lives. ""Thierry"" responded, Ms. O'Sullivan said. He steered her to a news story about a live chat function Facebook was testing but didn't say how to find it. Her mom's account was later unlocked without explanation. In March, Facebook introduced Facebook Protect, which it said added another layer of security to some accounts. Some users said the new feature instead blocked them from accessing Facebook. Thousands turned to JustAnswer, a website that connects people with experts in various industries. Soon after Facebook Protect was rolled out, JustAnswer said Facebook-related inquiries jumped 88% in a week. The site gets an average of about 3,000 questions a day regarding Facebook and Instagram troubles. ""People are overwhelmed, and they don't understand what's happened,"" said Cris Angulo, a tech expert at JustAnswer. ""They just want to hear someone's voice. Sometimes they think we are Facebook."" When Mr. Angulo and his colleagues can't solve a problem, they steer people back to Facebook's online directions. Meta hasn't expanded its customer service to accommodate its billions of users because of the enormous scale and expense of the undertaking, according to people familiar with the company. It also has viewed a call center as its own security risk, a potential path for bad actors to gain access to accounts for criminal or other nefarious purposes. The company said it has made some customer-service investments, including testing a live-chat option for some users locked out of their accounts, and it also fixed software bugs that had made it hard for people to regain access. Facebook and Instagram employees said they used to have an internal process for getting help. That avenue is now largely closed, some of them said. When The Wall Street Journal wrote about Facebook's confusing platform rules last year, a Facebook spokeswoman said the company planned to ""build out better customer support."" In December, the company began what it said was a small test of its live online chat function. A recent job posting for head of customer support operations at Meta said addressing customer service was ""a complex problem, and we are just 1% finished."" One idea that spread last year on Reddit and Quora involved buying a roughly $300 Oculus virtual-reality headset. Oculus, which is owned by Meta, has a dedicated customer-service line for the devices. Mr. Bacon said he learned about it from his wife, who heard something on National Public Radio. After his letter to Ms. Sandberg went unanswered, Mr. Bacon in December bought one of the headsets, which have been rebranded as Meta Quest. Two hours after speaking with someone in Oculus customer service, his Facebook account was restored. The headset, having done its work, is also retired. Mr. Bacon said it was now ""sitting casually on our TV stand."" (See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: At Facebook, You Are the Product, Not the Customer"" -- WSJ June 4, 2022)"
Meta_Facebook,Texas Sues Meta Over Facebook's Facial Technology,15 February 2022,The Wall Street Journal,957 words,-0.9719,0.037,0.072,0.891,"The Texas attorney general filed a suit against Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. on Monday, charging that the social-media giant's longstanding and now discontinued use of facial-recognition technology violated that state's privacy protections for personal biometric data. The lawsuit, filed in state district court in Marshall by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, seeks civil penalties in the hundreds of billions of dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter. In a statement, Mr. Paxton said the company's capture of facial geometry in photographs that users uploaded from 2010 to late last year resulted in ""tens of millions of violations"" of Texas law. ""Facebook has been secretly harvesting Texans' most personal information -- photos and videos -- for its own corporate profit,"" said Mr. Paxton, a Republican. ""Texas law has prohibited such harvesting without informed consent for over 20 years."" In a statement, Meta said the claims against Facebook ""are without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously."" Meta said that before it decided to shut down its facial recognition system, users were always provided with notice and an opportunity to consent when they used those services. Facebook previously settled another lawsuit over its facial-recognition practices, for about $650 million. That class-action suit filed in 2015 was brought under Illinois's biometric privacy law, which is similar in some respects to the Texas law. Both laws require individuals' consent before their biometric identifiers can be captured. In the class-action case, Facebook's lawyers said the Illinois law didn't apply to its method for identifying users in photos. The company also said it had given users the ability to opt out of the feature. Facebook's efforts to dismiss the case were unsuccessful, and the company settled the case in 2020. The Texas lawsuit -- in particular the size of the civil penalties being sought -- points to the impact that increasingly widespread privacy laws could have on big tech companies' operations. The case shows that ""states and individuals have a major role to play in privacy protection,"" said John Davisson, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research and advocacy group. ""We can't count on Congress and even the [Federal Trade Commission] to be on top of every data abuse,"" Mr. Davisson said. After Facebook's settlement of the Illinois class-action case became known, Texas sent its own civil subpoena to the company seeking information about the facial-recognition system. Facebook said it was ending its facial recognition system last November. ""These procedural protections are particularly crucial in our digital world because technology now permits the wholesale collection and storage of an individual's unique biometric identifiers -- identifiers that cannot be changed if compromised or misused,"" U.S. District Judge James Donato wrote in the class-action case. ""When an online service simply disregards the Illinois procedures, as Facebook is alleged to have done, the right of the individual to maintain her biometric privacy vanishes into thin air."" Texas said Facebook's facial-recognition system ignored legal requirements for capturing users' facial features. ""For over a decade . . . Facebook was secretly capturing, disclosing, unlawfully retaining -- and profiting off of -- Texans' most personal and highly sensitive information,"" the state argued in the complaint. The Texas law makes it unlawful to capture people's biometric identifiers without their informed consent and prohibits sharing that information. Unlike the Illinois law that led to the class-action suit, the Texas law can be enforced only by the state's attorney general. The Texas law also provides for a penalty of $25,000 per violation. The complaint estimated that at least 20 million Texans were members of Facebook in 2021. The civil subpoena issued by Texas demanded all the materials that Facebook had produced in response to the class-action lawsuit. Facebook's announcement that it would stop using facial recognition cited public concern over the technology. ""We're shutting down the Face Recognition system on Facebook,"" the company said in a blog post, explaining that it would ""delete more than a billion people's individual facial recognition templates."" It said that ""the many specific instances where facial recognition can be helpful need to be weighed against growing concerns about the use of this technology as a whole."" Texas officials said they are seeking to recover civil penalties for past violations of the law and that they would try to stop any future improper uses -- suggesting Meta might still retain some of the facial-recognition data it collected. ""Facebook announced, in November 2021, that it would cease use of the face-recognition feature on its Facebook social-media platform,"" the complaint says. ""Facebook has made no such commitment with respect to any of the other platforms or operations under its corporate umbrella, such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Reality Labs, or its upcoming virtual-reality metaverse."" In its blog post, Facebook said that ""amid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate."" The Texas investigation itself might have slowed at least some of the facial-recognition system's shutdown. Following the company's announcement in early November, Texas authorities demanded that relevant data be preserved while the state investigated. In a letter on Nov. 10, Texas officials said Facebook had confirmed that Meta ""will not delete any source code related to Facebook's Facial Recognition system,"" and would preserve metadata including which users had face templates saved. Facebook said it believed the face templates weren't material and could be deleted, according to the Nov. 10 letter. The attorney general's office demanded that Meta not delete any face template information."
Meta_Facebook,Inside Facebook's $10 Billion Breakup With Advertisers --- Privacy changes prompt e-commerce businesses to cut ad spending,19 February 2022,The Wall Street Journal,"1,872 words",0.7284,0.057,0.05,0.893,"Facebook was long one of the surest bets in digital advertising. No longer. Martha Krueger, who runs a gift-basket business called Giften Market, used to spend her entire advertising budget on Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook and Instagram. She picked up a new customer for every $14 she spent. When Apple Inc. introduced a privacy feature for mobile devices last year that restricts user tracking, she said, her costs to acquire such customers rose 10-fold. In October, she shifted her whole ad budget to search ads on Alphabet Inc.'s Google. Lots of other companies that depend on e-commerce sales, including makers of nutritional powders, eyebrow stencils and toilet sprays, are taking a look at their bottom lines and deciding the same thing. They are slashing their spending on Facebook and Instagram and sending their ad money to Google, Amazon.com Inc., Snap Inc. and other platforms, according to ad buyers and e-commerce companies. The privacy change is hitting the heart of Meta's business: its ability to target ads at users with precision and prove to marketers that the ads generate sales. Earlier this month, Meta said it expects a roughly $10 billion hit to sales this year as the result of the Apple change, which requires apps to ask users for permission to track their activity and share it. ""It kind of feels like the end of an era with Facebook's targeting ability,"" said Ms. Krueger. Google this week unveiled its own proposal to curtail tracking of users across apps on Android devices, potentially exacerbating Meta's challenges. ""Facebook has known for some time that they operated at the whim of the platforms on which consumers access their app,"" said Ari Paparo, an advertising-technology executive who sold his company to Comcast Corp. ""And now those platforms are changing the rules, and there's little they can do about it."" Meta has said that macroeconomic forces including inflation and supply-chain disruption also are putting pressure on ad spending. But the privacy push appears to be the biggest threat to the social-media giant's once ironclad grip on ad spending by small online businesses and e-commerce companies. Investor fears about the fallout from Apple's change are one of the reasons that Meta's market value has dropped by more than $300 billion since the recent earnings report. Facebook has been trying to blunt the effects of the Apple changes, and some analysts are optimistic that Meta will contain the damage and that its business could begin to rebound in the second half of 2022. Meta said in a written statement that it has more than 10 million advertisers. ""Apple's harmful policy is making it harder and more expensive for businesses of all sizes to reach their customers,"" it said. ""We believe Facebook and Instagram remain the best platforms for businesses to grow and connect with people, and we'll always keep working to improve performance and measurement."" Meta has been working to show advertisers that ads on Facebook and Instagram are driving more sales than its analytics show. And the company is developing new technology it hopes will give marketers nearly as much information about ad performance as they had before Apple's changes. Meta also has appealed to users to opt into device tracking. But data from app analytics provider Flurry shows that only 18% of U.S. users are choosing to do so across all apps. Meta has rolled out more e-commerce features within Facebook and Instagram so that more transactions happen within its own ecosystem. Apple's change could be the most disruptive innovation Meta ever faces, said analyst Daniel Newman of Futurum Research, which focuses on digital technology. ""Facebook has built its empire on the ability to acquire intimate details about user behavior across the internet,"" he said. ""Apple has changed the game."" Meta's big investment in the metaverse is an attempt to create a future in which it is not beholden to other device-makers, some ad industry executives said. Meta has been critical of Apple's move, saying it would hurt not only its revenue, but also small-business advertisers and app makers, and that Apple has created a false trade-off between personalized services and privacy. On Meta's Feb. 2 earnings call, Chief Financial Officer David Wehner criticized Apple and Google for contributing to its ad business's struggles and suggested that Apple's changes had benefited Google. He noted that Google pays billions of dollars to Apple annually to be the default search engine on iPhones. Meta has struck a more positive tone about Google's proposal to limit tracking, which isn't expected to go into effect for at least two years. Brows by Bossy, an eyebrow stencil maker, used to spend up to $7,000 a day on Facebook ads. As Apple's changes rolled out, ad prices ""started increasing, tracking was clearly not accurate any longer and the performance decreased,"" said Amanda Siebert, co-founder of the e-commerce company. She said the company slashed its Facebook spending by about 80% and shifted money elsewhere, including to Amazon search ads. Ath Sport, a company that makes and sells nutritional supplements for athletes, used to acquire a new customer for every $40 it spent on Facebook and Instagram ads. In summer 2021, that cost doubled, said Ath Sport owner Stuart Kam. Ath Sport cut its spending on Facebook ads and started spending 60% of its total marketing budget on Google search ads, which were more effective, he said. As companies like his spend more on Google, he said, the prices to advertise there are rising. Advertising industry executives said marketers began to think more about moving money away from Facebook back in the summer of 2020, before Apple's change. In the aftermath of the George Floyd murder, some brands temporarily boycotted Facebook over concerns about hate speech and faulty information on the platform. The ad executives said that was an inflection point for many companies who felt they had become too reliant on Facebook. ""It was a learning for everyone to understand that things could change. You have to have a backup plan and you have to diversify,"" said Kate Black, vice president of social strategy at Horizon Next, an ad firm that works with e-commerce companies. The Apple change was a tipping point. Ms. Black said the majority of her firm's clients have begun to shift 10% to 15% of their Facebook spending to other platforms such as TikTok. Clients are saying ""let's test and learn and see what we can do on other social platforms,"" she said. ""In terms of reach and scale, Meta is still the biggest player in the space and will definitely continue to be for many years to come, but others are definitely growing."" Toilet-spray maker -Pourri, which has relied heavily on Meta during the pandemic to generate e-commerce sales, said during the second half of 2021 that its return on its ad spending on Facebook began to decline as ad prices increased. While Facebook and Instagram still account for the majority of -Pourri's ad spending, the Apple changes have caused the company to start ""looking into new advertising channels,"" said Suzy Batiz, -Pourri's founder and chief executive. The company said it is seeking to shift about 30% of its ad dollars from Meta to diversify its spending. It already has begun to move some of its Facebook spending to TikTok, Amazon search ads and digital ad offerings from retailers such as Walmart Inc. Facebook's disclosure after its recent quarter that its number of users had declined for the first time is worrisome for advertisers, said Diana DiGuido, chief client officer of Tinuiti, a digital-marketing agency that works with consumer-products and e-commerce companies. Ms. DiGuido said some of her clients want to test TikTok and Snap more robustly to see whether they can reduce their spending on Facebook without hurting their businesses. The data squeeze from Apple's privacy measure has affected all digital ad players to some degree, but other companies have been more insulated from the impact than Facebook. Snap has relied on less data from across the web to target ads, and therefore it doesn't have as much work to do to compensate for the lost data, said Nii Ahene, Tinuiti's chief strategy officer. Snap posted a net profit of $22.6 million in the most recent quarter, after sales rose 42% from the year-ago period. Google serves up search ads to a user based on the keywords they enter. That differs from Facebook's effort to match ads to users based on its data and the targeting choices made by advertisers. Meta's chief financial officer said on the recent earnings call that he believed Google was somewhat shielded from the Apple change because it does a lot of business based on searches in desktop browsers, which weren't affected. That difference helped Google attract ad spending from e-commerce businesses, said digital-ad consultant Eric Seufert. Google's search-ad revenue increased 36% in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period, to $43.3 billion. Rivals have been working to snatch ad dollars away from Facebook, ad buyers said. Snap, Pinterest and TikTok increased incentives they offer to companies that make a significant commitment, the buyers said. TikTok has benefited from having lower ad pricing than Facebook, though the increased interest in the platform among advertisers might change that, said Mr. Ahene of Tinuiti. Just as Apple's changes made it harder to measure the effectiveness of Facebook ads on iPhones, Google's proposal could do the same when it comes to Facebook ads delivered to Android users. Google said it would give the industry substantial notice before ending its current system. The long timeline will give the ad industry time to prepare. Meta is navigating an unprecedented challenge to its advertising business, but not an unsolvable one, said Emad Hasan, former head of business marketing operations and analytics at Facebook and CEO of Retina AI, which helps brands target customers on social media. He said Meta can build new ad tools to find new ways to show marketers that their ads are performing well. Women's handbag brand Hammitt worked with Measured Inc., a company that uses statistical modeling to estimate how well Facebook ads are performing. The official rates reported by Facebook are abysmal, said Hammitt founder Tony Drockton, but Measured's reports showed Hammitt's Facebook ads are nearly as effective as they were before the privacy changes took effect. As a result, Hammitt reduced its Facebook ad spending only slightly, from 50% of its total ad budget to 43%. Hammitt's total dollars spent on Facebook actually increased because the company boosted its overall ad budget. Facebook has said it has been undercounting how effectively its ads have worked for advertisers, and that it has recently made progress in solving the problem."
Meta_Facebook,Facebook Parent Sued Over Scam Ads by Australian Regulator -- WSJ,18 March 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,790 words,-0.9923,0.049,0.11,0.84,"English , Inc. An Australian regulator is suing Meta Platforms Inc. for not doing enough to remove scam ads from Facebook that featured public figures promoting cryptocurrency, deepening the social media giant's legal troubles over the issue. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission alleged in federal court that the scam ads were still being displayed on Facebook even after public figures around the world complained that their names and images were being used without consent. One of them, Andrew Forrest, the chairman and largest shareholder of major iron ore producer Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., has filed litigation against Meta in Australian and American courts over similar fake ads. Meta said it has cooperated with the regulator's investigation so far and intends to defend itself in court. The company says it uses technology to detect and block scam ads and tries to get ahead of scammers' attempts to evade its detection systems. ""We don't want ads seeking to scam people out of money or mislead people on Facebook,"" a spokesperson said. ""They violate our policies and are not good for our community."" According to the Australian regulator, the ads had links that took Facebook users to a fake media article that included quotes from public figures endorsing a cryptocurrency or other moneymaking venture. Users were invited to sign up and subsequently pressured by scammers to deposit funds into the fake schemes, the regulator said. The ads included well-known Australians like businessman Dick Smith, television presenter David Koch and politician Mike Baird, the regulator said. The regulator said Meta's technology enabled the fake ads to target the users who were most likely to engage with them. When a user clicks the link in an ad and visits the ad's landing page, those visits generate substantial revenue for Facebook, the regulator said. In one instance, a person lost more than $450,000 due to a falsely advertised investment opportunity on Facebook, the regulator said. ""Meta should have been doing more to detect and then remove false or misleading ads on Facebook, to prevent consumers from falling victim to ruthless scammers,"" commission Chair Rod Sims said. ""The essence of our case is that Meta is responsible for these ads that it publishes on its platform."" Meta could face millions of dollars in penalties if a court finds the company breached Australian consumer laws. Meta has a review process to make sure ads that appear on Facebook comply with its advertising policies, the company has said. The review is largely automated, but it relies on employees to build and train the systems and in some cases ads are manually reviewed. Meta has taken legal action against organizations or individuals who are responsible for similar scam ads. In 2020, Meta said one defendant provided so-called cloaking software and services designed to circumvent automated ad review systems. When ads are cloaked, an ad review system may see a website showing an everyday product, but a user will see a different website that promotes deceptive products and services, Meta said at the time. Other public figures have had legal tussles with Facebook over scam ads. In early 2019, Facebook said it would donate $3.3 million to a project to fight scam ads in connection with the settlement of a lawsuit from Martin Lewis, a U.K. TV personality and the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, a consumer-finance website. He sued the social media company for defamation over scam ads that used his name and image. Meta has faced increased regulatory scrutiny all over the world after The Wall Street Journal published a series of articles, called The Facebook Files, that revealed harm caused by the social media company's platforms and its challenges in addressing those issues. Even before those articles were published, Australia had taken an aggressive stance in seeking to regulate big tech companies. Early last year, Australia's parliament passed legislation that effectively requires the likes of Facebook and Google parent Alphabet Inc. to pay news publishers for content, a move that was watched by lawmakers in other countries. More recently, Australia said it would introduce legislation to make social-media companies liable for defamatory comments published on their platforms, a move that risks exposing tech companies to lawsuits.

Meta_Facebook,"Meta Is Pressed on Governance --- Shareholder proposals seek stricter oversight of Facebook's efforts to reduce harm, risk",14 December 2021,The Wall Street Journal,"1,001 words",-0.566,0.056,0.06,0.884,"Meta Platforms Inc., formerly known as Facebook Inc., is confronting more calls from shareholders to address harm on its platforms and overall governance as the company responds to pressure from lawmakers and others. Shareholders, including the New York State Common Retirement Fund and Illinois State Treasurer, are among an investor group that collectively filed eight shareholder proposals for consideration at the company's annual meeting. The resolutions include calls for board oversight of efforts to reduce harmful content, an assessment of the risk of the company's metaverse efforts and a review of the social-media company's audit and risk committee, according to the Investor Alliance for Human Rights, an initiative of the faith-based investor group Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. Members of the same group last year submitted six proposals that were defeated by shareholders at the annual meeting, including a call for an independent board chair. Meta has a dual-class share structure, which grants supervoting power to certain stockholders. Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg can exercise control of supervoting shares representing about 58% of the vote, according to the proxy. ""Facebook is willing to allow a certain level of hate speech, political misinformation, and divisive rhetoric so it can make more money,"" Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs said. ""That is exactly why the board's governance structure must change."" Meta spokesman Ryan Moore said the company values its investors' views and engages with them regularly. ""We understand the responsibility that comes with operating a global platform where we must address some of the most complex issues impacting society and the internet at large,"" he said. ""We have every commercial and moral incentive to try to give the maximum number of people as much of a positive experience as possible on Facebook."" The shareholders' proposals come amid heightened criticism of the social-media company following revelations earlier this year in The Wall Street Journal's Facebook Files series that showed the company knew its platforms had flaws that caused harm to some of its users and it failed to fix them. Mr. Zuckerberg has said the criticism paints a false picture of the company he co-founded. Meta has faced a series of hearings and investigations over allegations of harm caused by its services. The head of Instagram, which is also owned by Meta, testified in Congress last week, clashing with lawmakers over the photo-sharing app's impact on young users. In mid-November, a bipartisan coalition of state attorneys general said it is investigating how Instagram attracts and affects young people. A Meta spokesman has said the investigation was premised on a misunderstanding of issues that also affect other social-media platforms. Shareholders are expected to further make their case at Meta's annual shareholder meeting, which typically takes place in May. In the winter, companies often meet privately with larger shareholders who make their case for changes. Some shareholders file proposals without talking to the company beforehand. After the Facebook Files published, more than 50 investors who are part of the Investor Alliance for Human Rights discussed what they should do to address the findings that Facebook's platforms cause harm, said Anita Dorett, director of the investor initiative, which represents more than $6 trillion in assets under management. Some investors said with the trove of internal Facebook documents and data there was a fresh opportunity to push for more transparency and structural changes. At least half a dozen investors in the group reached out to Facebook to express concerns and ask for more information, Ms. Dorett said. She added that the new and additional proposals filed by the group this year focus on harms Facebook causes given the new information from the internal documents. Meta's Mr. Moore said the company has spent more than $5 billion in 2021 on safety and security and has 40,000 people working on those issues. He added that Meta has invested in new ways to find and remove hate speech, cutting the amount of hate speech people see on Facebook by more than half in the past year. The deadline for shareholder proposals was Dec. 10. ""When the stock is going up, no one wants to complain about the governance issues at Meta Platforms, but the risks are always there,"" said Julie Goodridge, chief executive of NorthStar Asset Management Inc., which along with the New York State Common Retirement Fund filed a proposal calling for each share to have an equal vote. ""The recent revelations due to the whistleblower Frances Haugen reaffirmed what we already knew -- that no one can keep Zuckerberg accountable but himself. This structure is not good for the company or our society."" Mr. Moore said the company has strong corporate governance measures in place, pointing to its lead independent director and regular engagement with investors. As You Sow, a nonprofit, filed a shareholder proposal calling for greater board oversight of efforts to reduce harmful user-generated content. ""Shareholders need to understand why these technological solutions continue to fail to protect civil society,"" said Andrew Behar, CEO of As You Sow. Mr. Moore said the amplification of false, divisive, hateful and inciting content is harmful to Meta's community, and the company shares its progress through transparency reports. Meta's Audit and Risk Oversight Committee, for instance, receives reports from management on matters including safety, security, human rights and civil rights. Boutique investment firm Arjuna Capital filed a proposal asking for the board to commission a report assessing possible harms of the company's metaverse project. ""The same issues Facebook is reckoning with -- discrimination, human and civil-rights violations, incitement to violence, and privacy violations -- will only be heightened in the metaverse,"" said Natasha Lamb, managing partner of Arjuna Capital. Mr. Moore pointed to Mr. Zuckerberg and other executives' prior statements about building the metaverse responsibly and keeping people safe in virtual reality."
Meta_Facebook,EXCHANGE --- Meta Sued Over Scam Ads Shown On Facebook,19 March 2022,The Wall Street Journal,600 words,-0.9912,0.039,0.114,0.847,"An Australian regulator is suing Meta Platforms Inc., accusing it of not doing enough to remove scam ads from Facebook that featured public figures promoting cryptocurrency, deepening the social media giant's legal troubles overthe issue. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission alleged in federal court that the scam ads were still being displayed on Facebook even after public figures around the world complained that their names and images were being used without consent. One of them, Andrew Forrest, the chairman and largest shareholder of major iron ore producer Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., has filed litigation against Meta in Australian and American courts over similar fake ads. Meta said it has cooperated with the regulator's investigation so far and intends to defend itself in court. The company says it uses technology to detect and block scam ads and tries to get ahead of scammers' attempts to evade its detection systems. ""We don't want ads seeking to scam people out of money or mislead people on Facebook,"" a spokesperson said. ""They violate our policies and are not good for our community."" According to the Australian regulator, the ads had links that took Facebook users to a fake media article that included quotes from public figures endorsing a cryptocurrency or other moneymaking venture. Users were invited to sign up and subsequently pressured by scammers to deposit funds into the fake schemes, the regulator said. The ads included well-known Australians like businessman Dick Smith, television presenter David Koch and politician Mike Baird, the regulator said. The regulator said Meta's technology enabled the fake ads to target the users who were most likely to engage with them. When a user clicks the link in an ad and visits the ad's landing page, those visits generate substantial revenue for Facebook, the regulator said. In one instance, a person lost more than $450,000 due to a falsely advertised investment opportunity on Facebook, the regulator said. ""Meta should have been doing more to detect and then remove false or misleading ads on Facebook, to prevent consumers from falling victim to ruthless scammers,"" commission Chair Rod Sims said. ""The essence of our case is that Meta is responsible for these ads that it publishes on its platform."" Meta could face millions of dollars in penalties if a court finds the company breached Australian consumer laws. Meta has a review process to make sure ads that appear on Facebook comply with its advertising policies, the company has said. The review is largely automated, but it relies on employees to build and train the systems and in some cases ads are manually reviewed. Meta has taken legal action against organizations or individuals who are responsible for similar scam ads. In 2020, Meta said one defendant provided so-called cloaking software and services designed to circumvent automated ad review systems. When ads are cloaked, an ad review system may see a website showing an everyday product, but a user will see a different website that promotes deceptive products and services, Meta said at the time. Other public figures have had legal tussles with Facebook over scam ads. In early 2019, Facebook said it would donate $3.3 million to a project to fight scam ads in connection with the settlement of a lawsuit from Martin Lewis, a U.K. TV personality and the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, a consumer-finance website. He sued the social media company for defamation over scam ads that used his name and image. --- Stuart Condie contributed to this article."
Meta_Facebook,Meta Nixes Its Facebook Account Rule for Quest VR Headset,7 July 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,626 words,0.9915,0.082,0.008,0.91,"English , Inc. Meta Platforms Inc. on Thursday changed its requirements for logging into its virtual-reality headsets, saying it aims to provide more options for people to join its vision of the metaverse. Starting next month, people no longer will need a Facebook account to use the company’s VR devices, Meta said, a rule that users and potential customers have criticized. Having to create a Facebook account to use the VR gaming hardware could have kept out people unwilling to join the social network. It could have also presented a conflict with parents who didn’t mind their children on VR but didn’t want them on social media. Now, new and existing users will need to create a Meta account and a Meta Horizon social profile to use their VR devices. People who currently use an older Oculus account have until January to switch to a Meta account and Horizon profile. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has been pushing his company to build the next generation of the internet, known as the metaverse. It’s become such a big focus that Facebook changed its name to Meta in late October, and it removed the Oculus branding from its VR products, such as the Quest 2 headset. In its vision of the new virtual world, people will interact with each other as avatars, working, shopping and doing much of what they do in the real world. The new Meta accounts “will give everyone more choice about how you show up in the metaverse,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in a post on Facebook. Existing headset users can set up their new Meta accounts using Facebook, and new users also can use Facebook, Instagram or email to set up the Meta account. People who merged their Oculus accounts with Facebook accounts will be allowed to separate them, to keep their social-media profile separate from their VR. The Meta account is initially only meant to log into headsets and view and manage purchased VR apps, though the company expects to allow users to log into other products or services with it in the future. The Meta Horizon profiles—which can also be viewed in a web browser—include avatars, profile photos and other personal information, such as handles used when visiting virtual worlds. Under the changes, a user’s friends in VR will become “followers,” much like how Meta’s Instagram app operates. Users can connect their Instagram and Facebook accounts to their new Meta profiles, but they won’t have to. If they’re connected, users will enable more social interactions, such as finding Facebook friends to play VR games. Achievements, friends and apps that users purchased under the previous account will migrate over to the new Meta account as part of the setup process. Setting up a Meta account requires a user’s name, email address, phone number, payment information and date of birth. Meta said the information isn’t public, and users can create multiple Meta accounts. Meta also unveiled three privacy options for users: Open to Everyone, Friends and Family, and Solo. Setting a Meta Horizon profile to private will prompt the user to review and approve follower requests. Users ages 13 to 17 will have their Meta Horizon profiles set to private by default, part of Meta’s efforts to better protect younger users of its platforms. A Meta spokeswoman declined to comment on the reasons for the change beyond what was stated in the company’s blog posts. —For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter.

Meta_Facebook,Technology,2 June 2022,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,240 words",0.9951,0.101,0.031,0.868,"Sheryl Sandberg on Wednesday said she would be leaving her role as chief operating officer of Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc ., closing out her tenure helping lead one of the world's most profitable and controversial companies. In a post on her Facebook profile, Ms. Sandberg said she would continue to serve as a member of Meta's board. In a securities filing, Meta said she informed the company on Saturday of her intention to resign. Ms. Sandberg said her late husband told her she should take the job if she was planning to stay five years, and she stayed for 14. ""I really feel like the next generation of leaders are ready,"" Ms Sandberg said in an interview. ""It's been a long and great partnership with Mark, I really believe in the company, and I'm staying on the board. But it's probably time for me to have more flexibility and more ability to do more things with my time."" Javier Olivan , currently chief growth officer, will take over as the company's COO when Ms. Sandberg leaves. During her time at the company, Ms. Sandberg built out the business side, turning a free-to-access social-media startup founded in a Harvard dorm room into one of the biggest advertising companies on the planet. Last year, the company reported nearly $115 billion in advertising revenue. Ms. Sandberg was the longtime lieutenant to Mark Zuckerberg , and in that role—and as the author of the leadership book ""Lean In""—became one of the most prominent women in business . Ms. Sandberg, 52 years old, said she was looking forward to spending more time on her foundation and women's issues. Beyond that, she's not sure about what her life after Facebook will look like. ""This will be a chance to take a breath and figure it out,"" she said. ""This job and that kind of thought process really can't coexist."" Sheryl Sandberg's 14-Year Career at Facebook: Growth and Controversy Ms. Sandberg has been telling people that she feels burned out and that she has become a punching bag for the company's problems, according to people familiar with the matter. At Mr. Zuckerberg's direction, the company is also pivoting to a future focused on the development of virtual worlds— known as the metaverse —and that is less dependent on advertising, which has long been Ms. Sandberg's fiefdom. Ms. Sandberg has been notably absent from many of the meetings about the company's metaverse plans, said some of the people. ""Sheryl architected our ads business, hired great people, forged our management culture, and taught me how to run a company,"" Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a post on Wednesday. ""She created opportunities for millions of people around the world, and she deserves the credit for so much of what Meta is today."" As part of the reshuffling, Marne Levine , the company's chief business officer, will report to Mr. Olivan. ""I don't plan to replace Sheryl's role in our existing structure,"" Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. ""I'm not sure that would be possible since she's a superstar who defined the COO role in her own unique way."" ""But even if it were possible, I think Meta has reached the point where it makes sense for our product and business groups to be more closely integrated,"" Mr. Zuckerberg added. Ms. Sandberg received total compensation of $35.2 million in 2021, and owned about 1.5 million shares as of last month, according to Meta 's securities filings. Those shares were worth about $277 million at Wednesday's closing price. Her net worth is estimated at $1.6 billion, according to Forbes. Meta 's share price has fallen by about half from its peak last year, amid struggles in its core advertising business and a broader selloff in tech stocks. Shares ended down 2.6% on Wednesday, following the news of Ms. Sandberg's departure. Before her arrival at Facebook , Ms. Sandberg was vice president of global online sales and operations at Google . Share Your Thoughts What does Sheryl Sandberg 's departure mean for the future of Facebook ? Join the conversation below. After joining Facebook , when Mr. Zuckerberg was only 23 years old, she became the company's business strategist and resident grown-up, with direct responsibility for advertising sales, legal and policy issues. That structure allowed Mr. Zuckerberg to focus on engineering challenges. As the company grew into a tech giant, Ms. Sandberg's profile rose along with it. She wrote two bestselling books, gave commencement speeches and was a regular at high-profile gatherings of influential political figures and business executives, such as those in Davos, Switzerland, and Sun Valley, Idaho. A longtime Democrat, she was also regularly mentioned as a potential candidate for office or cabinet member. Ms. Sandberg's husband, Dave Goldberg, died in 2015 while the two were vacationing in Mexico . Her grief and how she recovered from it were the subject of her second book, ""Option B."" In recent years, Facebookbecame embroiled in a series of controversies around issues including data privacy and user safety, and Ms. Sandberg's role leading the company led to intense criticism at times. In 2018, Ms. Sandberg testified before Congress about election interference involving social media . That same year, The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Zuckerberg told Ms. Sandberg that he blamed her and her teams for the public fallout over Cambridge Analytica, the research firm that inappropriately accessed private data on Facebook users and used it for political research. Ms. Sandberg later confided in friends that she wondered if she should be worried about her job. Last year the Journal also wrote a series of investigative stories about the company, called The Facebook Files , that was based on thousands of internal documents and described the flaws in its platforms and the harms they cause users, among other issues. One of the articles cited internal data to show that Ms. Sandberg's portfolio within the company, as measured by staffers that report to her, has been shrinking in recent years . In April, The Wall Street Journal reported that Ms. Sandberg faced scrutiny at Meta over pressing a U.K. tabloid to shelve an article about her former boyfriend, Activision Blizzard Inc . CEO Bobby Kotick , and a 2014 temporary restraining order against him. A Meta spokeswoman at the time said Ms. Sandberg had never made a threat in her communications with the tabloid. Mr. Kotick said it was his understanding that the Daily Mail didn't run the story because it was untrue. The spokeswoman said on Wednesday that the matter had been resolved and had nothing to do with Ms. Sandberg's departure. In her post announcing her departure, Ms. Sandberg paid tribute to her longtime partnership with Mr. Zuckerberg. ""He sometimes says that we grew up together, and we have,"" she wrote. ""In the critical moments of my life, in the highest highs and in the depths of true lows, I have never had to turn to Mark, because he was already there.""

Meta_Facebook,Technology,13 December 2021,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,028 words",-0.5202,0.056,0.058,0.886,"Facebook is facing more calls from shareholders to address harm on its platforms and overall governance as the company, now known as Meta Platforms Inc ., responds to pressure from lawmakers and others. Shareholders, including the New York State Common Retirement Fund and Illinois State Treasurer, are among an investor group that collectively filed eight shareholder proposals for consideration at the company's annual meeting. The resolutions include calls for board oversight of efforts to reduce harmful content, an assessment of the risk of the company's metaverse efforts and a review of the social media company's audit and risk committee, according to the Investor Alliance for Human Rights, an initiative of the faith-based investor group Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility . Members of the same group last year submitted six proposals that were defeated by shareholders at the company's annual meeting, including a call for an independent board chair. Meta has a dual-class share structure, which grants supervoting power to certain holders. Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg can exercise control of supervoting shares representing about 58% of the vote, according to the proxy. ""Facebook is willing to allow a certain level of hate speech, political misinformation, and divisive rhetoric so it can make more money,"" Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs said. ""That is exactly why the board's governance structure must change."" Meta spokesman Ryan Moore said the company values its investors' views and engages with them regularly. ""We understand the responsibility that comes with operating a global platform where we must address some of the most complex issues impacting society and the internet at large,"" he said in a statement. ""We have every commercial and moral incentive to try to give the maximum number of people as much of a positive experience as possible on Facebook ."" The shareholders' proposals come amid heightened criticism of the social media company following revelations earlier this year in The Wall Street Journal's Facebook Files series that showed the company knew its platforms had flaws that caused harm to some of its users and it failed to fix them. Mr. Zuckerberg has said the criticism paints a false picture of the company he co-founded. Meta has faced a series of hearings and investigations over allegations of harm caused by its services. The head of Instagram , which is also owned by Meta , testified in Congress last week , clashing with lawmakers over the photo-sharing app's impact on young users. In mid-November, a bipartisan coalition of state attorneys general said it is investigating how Instagram attracts and affects young people . A Meta spokesman has said the investigation was premised on a misunderstanding of issues that also affect other social-media platforms. Shareholders are expected to further make their case at Meta 's annual shareholder meeting, which typically takes place in May. In the winter, companies often meet privately with larger shareholders who make their case for changes. Some shareholders file proposals without talking to the company beforehand. After the Facebook Files published, more than 50 investors who are part of the Investor Alliance for Human Rights discussed what they should do to address the findings that Facebook 's platforms cause harm, said Anita Dorett, director of the investor initiative, which represents more than $6 trillion in assets under management. Some investors said with the trove of internal Facebook documents and data there was a fresh opportunity to push for more transparency and structural changes. At least half a dozen investors in the group reached out to Facebook to express concerns and ask for more information, Ms. Dorett said. She added that the new and additional proposals filed by the group this year focus on harms Facebook causes given the new information from the internal documents. Meta 's Mr. Moore said the company has spent more than $5 billion in 2021 on safety and security and has 40,000 people working on those issues. He added that Meta has invested in new ways to find and remove hate speech, cutting the amount of hate speech people see on Facebook by more than half in the last year. The deadline for shareholder proposals was Dec. 10. ""When the stock is going up, no one wants to complain about the governance issues at Meta Platforms , but the risks are always there,"" said Julie Goodridge, chief executive of NorthStar Asset Management Inc. , which along with the New York State Common Retirement Fund filed a proposal calling for each share to have an equal vote. ""The recent revelations due to the whistleblower Frances Haugen reaffirmed what we already knew—that no one can keep Zuckerberg accountable but himself. This structure is not good for the company or our society."" Mr. Moore said the company has strong corporate governance measures in place, pointing to its lead independent director and regular engagement with investors. As You Sow, a nonprofit, filed a shareholder proposal calling for greater board oversight of efforts to reduce harmful user-generated content. ""Shareholders need to understand why these technological solutions continue to fail to protect civil society,"" said Andrew Behar, CEO of As You Sow.

Meta_Facebook,Facebook Struggles With E-Commerce as Meta Looks to Revamp its Ads Business -- WSJ,3 May 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"2,749 words",0.9881,0.074,0.021,0.906,"English , Inc. By Salvador Rodriguez and Charity L. Scott Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. developed e-commerce services in 2020 as people shopped more from home and the company faced a changing digital ad market. Two years later, employees, former executives and retailers say the division remains a work in progress. Some retailers say they are frustrated by Meta's e-commerce rollout, noting that the service is missing basic components such as the ability to offer items in different colors or sizes, limit where a merchant can ship items and provide next-day or same-day deliveries. Other stores, though, see the promise of connecting with shoppers through the large user bases of Facebook and Instagram. At least five senior executives have left in the past six months, according to a former senior executive in the division. Facebook is confident in its e-commerce business. ""Building a full-fledged commerce platform is a multiyear journey -- one that became a company priority less than two years ago,"" said Joe Osborne, a spokesperson for Meta. ""We're proud of our progress and in the teams working to build out these experiences."" Meta began ramping up its efforts in e-commerce during the early days of the pandemic, launching features called Facebook and Instagram Shops in May 2020. The shops let brands post their catalogs directly on Facebook and Instagram. Some brands use the shops to direct users to purchase on their websites while others choose to sell the items to users via Meta's services. Meta also started bracing for the impact of privacy changes Apple Inc. announced in June 2020 for its iPhone and iPad devices. Those changes, which rolled out in April 2021, allowed users to opt out of having their activity on their devices tracked by companies like Meta. That tracking data was critical to how Meta measures the effectiveness of advertisements. The loss of that data drove advertisers elsewhere, putting a major dent in the company's earnings for the past two quarters. Since February, when Meta posted disappointing user growth and revenue and said Apple's new policy would cost more than $10 billion in lost sales for 2022, the company's shares have dropped more than 34%. That is equivalent to a loss of $307.8 billion in market value. About 97% of Meta's revenue comes from advertising, according to its first-quarter results. Meta also said it would be spending more as the company pivots to the metaverse, a virtual world where people work, play and interact. Online shopping offers a way to ease the impact from the Apple changes. By developing channels of commerce within its apps, Meta can measure the effectiveness of ads within its own services and reclaim some of the data it lost. The potential is significant: Amazon.com Inc., which dominates in e-commerce, reported $7.88 billion in ad sales in its most recent quarter, a 23% increase from the same period a year ago. Meta doesn't break out results from its shopping business, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last week that the company recently saw a pullback in e-commerce usage. Other online retailers, like Amazon, have also talked about an e-commerce slowdown as more Covid-19 restrictions are lifted and people return to in-person shopping in recent months. ""Other challenges are broader macro trends, like the softness in e-commerce after the acceleration we saw during the pandemic,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said. Among commerce's most notable departures are Vice President of Commerce Business and Operations Gene Alston, who announced in Meta's Workplace recently that he would be leaving the company, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Alston had been responsible for all strategy and teams for commerce products across Meta's family of apps. Roi Tiger, vice president of engineering for commerce across the company, also announced his departure on Workplace, according to a person familiar with the matter. Eddie Garcia, who previously served as chief product officer for Sam's Club and was brought in last June to run the company's Marketplace feature, left the company in March and was recently announced as eBay Inc.'s chief product officer. Chris Olaniran is a user who wanted to create an Instagram Shop for his clothing brand, Vital Clothing. That process required setups on both Facebook and Instagram, and in Mr. Olaniran's case, on Shopify Inc., a Canadian e-commerce company that he uses to host his online store. ""This is where I first realized, OK, this is a lot more complicated than I thought,"" he said. After making the necessary changes to both his Instagram and Facebook accounts, linking them to his product catalog in Shopify and getting approval to sell, Mr. Olaniran struggled to get all of his items to appear in the shop. He said he never figured out how to get changes to his product catalog to show up. ""You would think that there would be some sort of accessible method of support, but after trying to solve the issue myself, it really became apparent that it's really the exact opposite,"" he said. Meta said businesses can get support in a number of ways and pointed to an online help center. Mr. Olaniran eventually abandoned the idea of having an Instagram Shop. ""I've started the process of setting up an Etsy store to have in combination with my website,"" he said. ""It just really comes down to, is it worth my time?"" Meta recently began showing a promotion to Instagram users, offering them 20% off when they make their first e-commerce order through the social network. More notably, the company is set to expand the availability of ads within the Facebook and Instagram Shops feature, a format it announced in June 2021, in which ads send users to curated collections from a shop or a business's website. There are approximately 200 sellers doing early testing of Shops ads, according to a Meta employee. For many well-established retailers and brands, Facebook and Instagram Shops represent a tantalizing glimpse into the future. Michael Karanikolas, co-founder and co-CEO of influencer-driven apparel brand Revolve Group, told investors last May that Instagram Shops is a ""very small"" contributor to the company's bottom line. ""We think long term [Instagram shopping] is a part of the overall suite of options that we have for our customer,"" he said. Kevin Gould, founder and CEO of Kombo Ventures, a holding company with brands that sell products on Instagram, said he would like to see Meta do a large awareness campaign introducing Facebook and Instagram Shops to users. Better integration with Shopify, and adding features like discount code support, would make the commerce offerings more compelling, he said. Some merchants are seeing sales growth through Facebook and Instagram Shops. Facebook and Instagram drive about 50% of revenue for BlendJet Inc., a portable blender company, said CEO Ryan Pamplin, but most of that comes from ads that point consumers to BlendJet's website. In recent months, the company has seen an uptick in sales directly on its Facebook and Instagram Shops, Mr. Pamplin said. This year through April, BlendJet's sales on Meta's commerce features are up about 300% compared with the year-earlier period, he said. Mr. Pamplin attributed the uptick to a number of shopping features Meta has recently added, including product reviews and expanded product descriptions. Mr. Pamplin said some important features are still missing -- most notably the ability to add more than one photo for each color of a product or the ability to include videos for products -- but he said he has faith in Meta's commerce teams. ""I've been involved as an advertiser for a very long time, and I've adopted everything that they've come out with,"" Mr. Pamplin said. ""And, you know, I'm loyal to the results."" and Charity L.

The potential is significant: Amazon.com Inc., which dominates in e-commerce, reported $7.88 billion in ad sales in its most recent quarter, a 23% increase from the same period a year ago. Meta doesn't break out results from its shopping business, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last week that the company recently saw a pullback in e-commerce usage. Other online retailers, like Amazon, have also talked about an e-commerce slowdown as more Covid-19 restrictions are lifted and people return to in-person shopping in recent months. ""Other challenges are broader macro trends, like the softness in e-commerce after the acceleration we saw during the pandemic,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said. Among commerce's most notable departures are Vice President of Commerce Business and Operations Gene Alston, who announced in Meta's Workplace recently that he would be leaving the company, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Alston had been responsible for all strategy and teams for commerce products across Meta's family of apps. Roi Tiger, vice president of engineering for commerce across the company, also announced his departure on Workplace, according to a person familiar with the matter. Eddie Garcia, who previously served as chief product officer for Sam's Club and was brought in last June to run the company's Marketplace feature, left the company in March and was recently announced as eBay Inc.'s chief product officer. Chris Olaniran is a user who wanted to create an Instagram Shop for his clothing brand, Vital Clothing. That process required setups on both Facebook and Instagram, and in Mr. Olaniran's case, on Shopify Inc., a Canadian e-commerce company that he uses to host his online store. ""This is where I first realized, OK, this is a lot more complicated than I thought,"" he said. After making the necessary changes to both his Instagram and Facebook accounts, linking them to his product catalog in Shopify and getting approval to sell, Mr. Olaniran struggled to get all of his items to appear in the shop. He said he never figured out how to get changes to his product catalog to show up. ""You would think that there would be some sort of accessible method of support, but after trying to solve the issue myself, it really became apparent that it's really the exact opposite,"" he said. Meta said businesses can get support in a number of ways and pointed to an online help center. Mr. Olaniran eventually abandoned the idea of having an Instagram Shop. ""I've started the process of setting up an Etsy store to have in combination with my website,"" he said. ""It just really comes down to, is it worth my time?"" Meta recently began showing a promotion to Instagram users, offering them 20% off when they make their first e-commerce order through the social network. More notably, the company is set to expand the availability of ads within the Facebook and Instagram Shops feature, a format it announced in June 2021, in which ads send users to curated collections from a shop or a business's website. There are approximately 200 sellers doing early testing of Shops ads, according to a Meta employee. For many well-established retailers and brands, Facebook and Instagram Shops represent a tantalizing glimpse into the future. Michael Karanikolas, co-founder and co-CEO of influencer-driven apparel brand Revolve Group, told investors last May that Instagram Shops is a ""very small"" contributor to the company's bottom line. ""We think long term [Instagram shopping] is a part of the overall suite of options that we have for our customer,"" he said. Kevin Gould, founder and CEO of Kombo Ventures, a holding company with brands that sell products on Instagram, said he would like to see Meta do a large awareness campaign introducing Facebook and Instagram Shops to users. Better integration with Shopify, and adding features like discount code support, would make the commerce offerings more compelling, he said. Facebook says it added some discount features in late 2020. Some merchants are seeing sales growth through Facebook and Instagram Shops. Facebook and Instagram drive about 50% of revenue for BlendJet Inc., a portable blender company, said CEO Ryan Pamplin, but most of that comes from ads that point consumers to BlendJet's website. In recent months, the company has seen an uptick in sales directly on its Facebook and Instagram Shops, Mr. Pamplin said. This year through April, BlendJet's sales on Meta's commerce features are up about 300% compared with the year-earlier period, he said. Mr. Pamplin attributed the uptick to a number of shopping features Meta has recently added, including product reviews and expanded product descriptions. Mr. Pamplin said some important features are still missing -- most notably the ability to add more than one photo for each color of a product or the ability to include videos for products -- but he said he has faith in Meta's commerce teams. ""I've been involved as an advertiser for a very long time, and I've adopted everything that they've come out with,"" Mr. Pamplin said. ""And, you know, I'm loyal to the results."" and Charity L.

Meta_Facebook,Business/Financial Desk; SECTB,3 November 2021,The New York Times,"1,314 words",0.9883,0.085,0.036,0.879,"3 English .  After the social media giant auditioned agencies to manage its ad budget, underscoring its Madison Avenue ties, Spark Foundry won the business. Since the spring, the social media company formerly known as Facebook has been evaluating where it advertises and how much it spends doing so, taking pitches from agencies that want to help manage its enormous marketing budget. The so-called media review -- the first for Meta, the new parent company name for Facebook and its sister apps Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger -- concluded on Tuesday when it chose the Spark Foundry agency as its new global planning and buying partner. Spark Foundry, owned by the French ad giant Publicis, will handle ''strategic thought leadership, media innovation, planning and investment, cross-channel approaches, tools, tech and operations,'' Lisa Stratton, a spokeswoman for Meta, said in an email. The global agency, which replaces the social network's previous media partners, Dentsu and Mindshare, also recently won business from the beauty retailer Clarins and the automaker Toyota. The decision does not affect Meta's creative strategy. Meta made the change after a seven-month review, during which it came under intense public scrutiny from damaging revelations about its business practices and its apps' effects on teenagers, fueled by the whistle-blower Frances Haugen, a former employee. Even as the social platform grappled with the scandals, major ad companies presented pitches for what would be an especially high-profile client. Meta shelled out nearly $3.6 billion on marketing and sales in the most recent quarter, 32 percent more than a year earlier. Winning the Meta account offered agencies access to the social media behemoth's deep pockets and sizable influence. The situation underscores Madison Avenue's codependence on Meta. Most of the advertising industry is either already in business with the company or hopes to be, usually by placing ads on its platforms or placing ads for Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger on other platforms. Last month, Meta said it earned 97 percent of its revenue, or $28.3 billion, by selling ad space in the most recent quarter. Advertising Week, a recent industry conference, featured panels presented by Meta, which has also sponsored events for the Association of National Advertisers and the American Association of Advertising Agencies. Meta employees sit on the boards of industry trade groups such as the Interactive Advertising Bureau and the American Advertising Federation. The ad industry spawned Facebook and is ''the hidden hand behind all the appalling Facebook headlines,'' but has remained largely circumspect about the company, wrote Bob Hoffman, a veteran of the business, in his Ad Contrarian newsletter last month. ''While the rest of the world is nauseated by Facebook's activities, the industry that has the deepest connection to it, and has the most to lose, is ours. And yet ... crickets.'' Bob Liodice, the chief executive of the ANA, said in an email that the group took brand safety concerns seriously but that its members ''are responsible for making their own investment choices to determine the suitability of a specific platform or media vehicle for their brand building.'' The IAB did not respond to a request for comment. The American Association of Advertising Agencies said it would continue to address issues related to ensuring a safe and transparent ecosystem. But one company, the outdoor apparel and equipment seller Patagonia, said it had stopped all paid advertising on Meta's platforms last year because of brand safety issues. ''The internal Facebook documents released over the last few weeks have made it incredibly clear that they know the irreparable damage that their lack of accountability causes their three billion users and the corrosive effects that has on society itself,'' Ryan Gellert, Patagonia's chief executive, said in an emailed statement. Meta, like many other companies, works with both creative agencies, which help design and produce marketing campaigns, and with media agencies, which help determine where the ads go. It has relationships with almost all of the modern ad industry, which is made up mostly of six large holding companies -- Dentsu, Havas, IPG, Omnicom, Publicis and WPP -- which control a constellation of subsidiary agencies. Meta also works with consulting companies like Accenture, which have bought up agencies in recent years, and some independent shops. On the creative side, Droga5, owned by Accenture, helps Meta craft corporate messaging and created videos for the company timed to the Olympics. BBDO, owned by Omnicom, does marketing campaigns for WhatsApp and the main Facebook app. Johannes Leonardo, which is partially owned by WPP, took over Instagram work from Ogilvy this spring. Meta also has an internal team, known as Creative X, working on marketing. Wieden+Kennedy, an independent agency based in Portland, was responsible for the overall Facebook brand and created the company's commercial for the 2020 Super Bowl. But during a large-scale boycott of the social network last year by advertisers upset with the platform's policy around hate speech, Colleen DeCourcy, Wieden+Kennedy's chief creative officer, said the situation ''created a lot of hard conversations inside the agency.'' Asked in Time magazine whether she expected Facebook to be a client in 2021, she said: ''If I was a betting person? I wouldn't put too many of my dollars on that space.'' A Wieden+Kennedy spokeswoman said the agency was no longer working with Meta and that they parted ways in the first half of the year. Since it started spending in earnest on marketing in 2014, Facebook had entrusted its media budget to Dentsu and Mindshare, an agency owned by WPP. It began its media review in April, working with the management consulting firm ID Comms, a matchmaker of sorts that also oversaw reviews this year for Hershey's and T-Mobile. Meta required participating agencies to agree to restrictive contract terms before allowing them to move forward to various budget planning and buying exercises, said two people with knowledge of the negotiations who were not authorized to speak publicly. Meta declined to comment on the process. As Meta's troubles mounted, employees at some of the agencies protested the idea having the company as a client, the people said. In July, Mindshare removed itself from the social network's media review, which was conducted virtually. Meta took Havas, another ad giant, out of the running last month. Publicis' Spark Foundry won the pitch over its final rival, Dentsu. ''We have a long legacy of leading brands through transformation and look forward to working with Meta on the next evolution of their business,'' said Sarah Kramer, the chief executive of Spark Foundry US, in a statement. ''Meta remains a transformative global partner for Dentsu International,'' that company said in a statement. ''Our drive to co-build integrated marketing solutions for our extensive mutual clients will continue unabated. We look forward to the continuation of our pioneering partnership in 2022 and beyond.'' Mindshare and Havas did not immediately have a comment. GroupM, which runs Mindshare, declined to comment. Meta has also grappled with complaints about mistreating the ad industry. Ms. Haugen, the whistle-blower, testified that the company had misled advertisers about its efforts to fortify its platform against harmful content and has tried to block efforts to excavate data about political ads. The true test of Madison Avenue's patience with Meta will depend on the company's popularity with users, said Blake Droesch, an analyst with eMarketer, on a recent podcast from the research firm. ''Users leaving Facebook is the only thing that would make advertisers leave Facebook,'' he said. An advertisement for in 2019.

Meta_Facebook,Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg Testifies in FTC Case to Block Virtual-Reality Deal -- WSJ,20 December 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"3,216 words",0.7184,0.07,0.051,0.879,"English , Inc. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the witness stand Tuesday in a case in which the Federal Trade Commission is seeking to prevent the social-media company from acquiring a virtual-reality startup. The FTC is seeking an injunction blocking Meta's planned acquisition of Within Unlimited Inc., the company behind the popular virtual-reality fitness game ""Supernatural."" The legal move poses a direct challenge to Meta's strategic focus on the metaverse, a term used to describe a platform where numerous online users work and play in virtual worlds. The case is widely seen as a test of FTC Chair Lina Khan's expansive interpretation of antitrust law and the commission's potential to rein in the power of the world's biggest technology companies. The lawsuit is based on the theory that the deal is set to cause competitive harm because it may limit potential future competition in a nascent industry, a legal interpretation that some antitrust specialists said was unusual. In Meta's opening remarks, the tech company argued that the FTC is trying to set a precedent that ""if you're big, you've got an interest in something and we think you'd rather ought to build it, we're going to stop you from buying it and we're going to make you build it,"" said Mark Hansen, a lawyer for the company. ""Your honor, that's not the law. If it became the law, it would doom just about every single vertical acquisition,"" Mr. Hansen said. In its July complaint, the FTC accused Meta of trying to buy its way to the top of the virtual-reality market, rather than competing or building its own products. In its opening remarks this month, the FTC argued that Meta could have chosen to use its resources to build its own app, and it was planning to do so until it heard a rumor that rival Apple Inc. was interested in buying Within Unlimited, said Abby Dennis, senior trial counsel at the FTC, in her opening remarks. ""Instead of building its own VR-dedicated fitness app, Meta just decided to acquire the market leader, 'Supernatural,'"" Ms. Dennis said. Since Facebook's name change to Meta in October 2021, Mr. Zuckerberg has talked about positioning his company to become the leader in the metaverse. Over the past year, the company has been unable to gain much traction in its efforts to sell its Quest VR headsets and lure users onto its metaverse apps. In its quarterly earnings report released in October, Meta's Reality Labs unit, which is driving the company's virtual-reality and metaverse efforts, posted revenue of $285 million for the quarter, a decline of nearly 49% from a year ago. Internal company documents also showed that the company's flagship metaverse, Horizon Worlds, had initially set a goal of reaching 500,000 monthly active users by the end of 2022, but it had fewer than 200,000 as of October, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. 20 Dec 2022 Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg Testifies in FTC Case to Block Virtual-Reality Deal -- WSJ By Salvador Rodriguez and Jeff Horwitz Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc.

Meta_Facebook,*Meta Shareholders Press Facebook for Governance Changes Ahead of Annual Meeting,13 December 2021,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,076 words",-0.5789,0.052,0.051,0.897,"English , Inc. 13 Dec 2021 *Meta Shareholders File at Least Eight Proposals Including Calls for Independent Chair, Oversight of Harmful Content 13 Dec 2021 *Meta Says It Values Shareholder Views, Understands Need to Make Facebook a Positive Experience 13 Dec 2021 Shareholders Press Facebook for Governance Changes By Emily Glazer Facebook is facing more calls from shareholders to address harm on its platforms and overall governance as the company, now known as Meta Platforms Inc., responds to pressure from lawmakers and others. Shareholders, including the New York State Common Retirement Fund and Illinois State Treasurer, are among an investor group that collectively filed eight shareholder proposals for consideration at the company's annual meeting. The resolutions include calls for board oversight of efforts to reduce harmful content, an assessment of the risk of the company's metaverse efforts and a review of the social media company's audit and risk committee, according to the Investor Alliance for Human Rights, an initiative of the faith-based investor group Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. Members of the same group last year submitted six proposals that were defeated by shareholders at the company's annual meeting, including a call for an independent board chair. Meta has a dual-class share structure, which grants supervoting power to certain holders. Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg can exercise control of supervoting shares representing about 58% of the vote, according to the proxy. ""Facebook is willing to allow a certain level of hate speech, political misinformation, and divisive rhetoric so it can make more money,"" Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs said. ""That is exactly why the board's governance structure must change."" Meta spokesman Ryan Moore said the company values its investors' views and engages with them regularly. ""We understand the responsibility that comes with operating a global platform where we must address some of the most complex issues impacting society and the internet at large,"" he said in a statement. ""We have every commercial and moral incentive to try to give the maximum number of people as much of a positive experience as possible on Facebook."" The shareholders' proposals come amid heightened criticism of the social media company following revelations earlier this year in The Wall Street Journal's Facebook Files series that showed the company knew its platforms had flaws that caused harm to some of its users and it failed to fix them. Mr. Zuckerberg has said the criticism paints a false picture of the company he co-founded. Meta has faced a series of hearings and investigations over allegations of harm caused by its services. The head of Instagram, which is also owned by Meta, testified in Congress last week, clashing with lawmakers over the photo-sharing app's impact on young users. In mid-November, a bipartisan coalition of state attorneys general said it is investigating how Instagram attracts and affects young people. A Meta spokesman has said the investigation was premised on a misunderstanding of issues that also affect other social-media platforms. Shareholders are expected to further make their case at Meta's annual shareholder meeting, which typically takes place in May. In the winter, companies often meet privately with larger shareholders who make their case for changes. Some shareholders file proposals without talking to the company beforehand. After the Facebook Files published, more than 50 investors who are part of the Investor Alliance for Human Rights discussed what they should do to address the findings that Facebook's platforms cause harm, said Anita Dorett, director of the investor initiative, which represents more than $6 trillion in assets under management. Some investors said with the trove of internal Facebook documents and data there was a fresh opportunity to push for more transparency and structural changes. At least half a dozen investors in the group reached out to Facebook to express concerns and ask for more information, Ms. Dorett said. She added that the new and additional proposals filed by the group this year focus on harms Facebook causes given the new information from the internal documents. Meta's Mr. Moore said the company has spent more than $5 billion in 2021 on safety and security and has 40,000 people working on those issues. He added that Meta has invested in new ways to find and remove hate speech, cutting the amount of hate speech people see on Facebook by more than half in the last year. The deadline for shareholder proposals was Dec. 10. ""When the stock is going up, no one wants to complain about the governance issues at Meta Platforms, but the risks are always there,"" said Julie Goodridge, chief executive of NorthStar Asset Management Inc., which along with the New York State Common Retirement Fund filed a proposal calling for each share to have an equal vote. ""The recent revelations due to the whistleblower Frances Haugen reaffirmed what we already knew -- that no one can keep Zuckerberg accountable but himself. This structure is not good for the company or our society."" Mr. Moore said the company has strong corporate governance measures in place, pointing to its lead independent director and regular engagement with investors. As You Sow, a nonprofit, filed a shareholder proposal calling for greater board oversight of efforts to reduce harmful user-generated content. ""Shareholders need to understand why these technological solutions continue to fail to protect civil society,"" said Andrew Behar, CEO of As You Sow. Mr. Moore said the amplification of false, divisive, hateful and inciting content is harmful to Meta's community, and the company shares its progress through transparency reports. Meta's Audit and Risk Oversight Committee, for instance, receives reports from management on matters including safety, security, human rights and civil rights. Boutique investment firm Arjuna Capital filed a proposal asking for the board to commission a report assessing possible harms of the company's metaverse project. ""The same issues Facebook is reckoning with -- discrimination, human and civil-rights violations, incitement to violence, and privacy violations -- will only be heightened in the metaverse,"" said Natasha Lamb, managing partner of Arjuna Capital. Mr. Moore pointed to Mr. Zuckerberg and other executives' prior statements about building the metaverse responsibly and keeping people safe in virtual reality.

Meta_Facebook,Business/Financial Desk; SECTB,6 November 2021,The New York Times,954 words,0.9878,0.069,0.022,0.909,"1 English .  The social networking company has discussed opening physical stores to showcase its virtual reality and augmented reality devices. SAN FRANCISCO -- One of Mark Zuckerberg's first steps toward building the metaverse may be physical instead of virtual. Meta, the social media company formerly known as Facebook, has discussed opening retail stores that will eventually span the world, said people with knowledge of the project and company documents viewed by The New York Times. The stores would be used to introduce people to devices made by the company's Reality Labs division, such as virtual reality headsets and, eventually, augmented reality glasses, they said. These devices are gateways to the metaverse, a futuristic digital world where people move from virtual to augmented versions of reality almost seamlessly. Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive, last week renamed his company Meta and laid out a vision for pursuing the metaverse as the next social platform. The stores would help show people that virtual reality and augmented reality can be fun and exciting, exactly the way Mr. Zuckerberg sees it. The aim of the stores is to make the world ''more open and connected,'' according to the company documents viewed by The Times. They are also intended to spark emotions like ''curiosity, closeness,'' as well as a sense of feeling ''welcomed'' while experimenting with headsets in a ''judgment free journey,'' according to the documents. Discussions about physical stores predated Facebook's rebranding by many months, with serious work on the initiative having started last year, the people said. And the project, which is still in development, may not proceed, they said. But if Meta moves forward with stores, it would be a first for a tech giant that has existed largely digitally, with more than 3.5 billion people using its apps such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. A Meta spokeswoman said the company couldn't confirm plans for stores but said its latest virtual reality headset was ''in high demand'' and that its hardware was available at partner retailers. Mr. Zuckerberg has talked up the metaverse as his company grapples with regulatory and societal challenges. Frances Haugen, a former employee turned whistle-blower, amassed thousands of pages of internal documents and recently shared them with lawmakers and the news media. She has said that Facebook was not doing enough to protect society from the harms it causes. Her disclosures have drawn scrutiny from legislators and regulators, though it is unclear how strong her case is. Skepticism about the metaverse also abounds. While Meta's Reality Labs division has had modest past success with the Oculus Quest 2, a low-priced headset that was popular last year, virtual reality remains a niche market for hobbyists and enthusiasts. The hardware is often costly and can be difficult to use. Some people have reported that the headsets nauseate them. ''We are, at best guess, at least five to 10 years out from a fully fleshed out Meta product or service,'' said Tim Derdenger, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. He said what Meta was working on was akin to the computer game Second Life from the early 2000s, calling it ''a second shot at a Second Life-like service, but that is hopefully more immersive.'' Still, Mr. Zuckerberg has said he sees the moment to build what he believes will be the next major shift in computing platforms since the smartphone era. In that future, Mr. Zuckerberg's apps would no longer be beholden to the rules dictated by Apple and Google, which own the app stores that distribute Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. Technology companies opening their own stores is not new. Gateway, a personal-computer maker, had its own stores in the 1990s. Apple has retail stores so people can test out devices and get their questions answered. Microsoft, Amazon and others have followed with their own stores as well. In recent years, Meta had experimented with some physical retail efforts. It opened ''pop-up'' kiosks at airports and a pop-up store in Manhattan's SoHo district to show its Oculus hardware products. It also had a pop-up location with Macy's in 2018, with the aim of bringing more small business onto the platform. Should Meta's new stores proceed, they would feature products such as Portal devices -- teleconferencing gadgets that let people video chat over Facebook -- as well as the Oculus headsets, the company documents said. The stores could also include voice-activated sunglasses that Meta developed with Ray-Ban, which people can use to take photos and video. Early designs for Meta's stores appeared modern, with a flat, minimalist aesthetic to the building exteriors and subtle placement of the Facebook brand, according to the documents. The company considered naming its stores Facebook Hub, Facebook Commons, Facebook Innovations, Facebook Reality Store and From Facebook, before eventually settling on the Facebook Store as a leading candidate, the documents said. It was unclear how the Meta rebranding would affect the naming of the stores. Andrew Bosworth, a longtime Facebook executive who will become Meta's chief technology officer, said last week that the Oculus brand would be discontinued and replaced by the Meta name. The Oculus Quest will become the Meta Quest, while the Facebook Portal will be rebranded the Meta Portal, he said. The flagship Facebook Store had been planned for Burlingame, Calif., where Meta has an office for its Reality Labs employees. It was also unclear whether those plans would continue. Virtual-reality headsets would be among the products sold at stores. (PHOTOGRAPH BY TONY AVELAR/ASSOCIATED PRESS) (B4)"
Meta_Facebook,Inside Facebook's $10 Billion Breakup With Advertisers -- WSJ,19 February 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"2,126 words",-0.2341,0.053,0.054,0.893,"A1 English , Inc. Privacy changes prompt e-commerce businesses to cut ad spending By Suzanne Vranica, Patience Haggin and Salvador Rodriguez Facebook was long one of the surest bets in digital advertising. No longer. Martha Krueger, who runs a gift-basket business called Giften Market, used to spend her entire advertising budget on Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook and Instagram. She picked up a new customer for every $14 she spent. When Apple Inc. introduced a privacy feature for mobile devices last year that restricts user tracking, she said, her costs to acquire such customers rose 10-fold. In October, she shifted her whole ad budget to search ads on Alphabet Inc.'s Google. Lots of other companies that depend on e-commerce sales, including makers of nutritional powders, eyebrow stencils and toilet sprays, are taking a look at their bottom lines and deciding the same thing. They are slashing their spending on Facebook and Instagram and sending their ad money to Google, Amazon.com Inc., Snap Inc. and other platforms, according to ad buyers and e-commerce companies. The privacy change is hitting the heart of Meta's business: its ability to target ads at users with precision and prove to marketers that the ads generate sales. Earlier this month, Meta said it expects a roughly $10 billion hit to sales this year as the result of the Apple change, which requires apps to ask users for permission to track their activity and share it. ""It kind of feels like the end of an era with Facebook's targeting ability,"" said Ms. Krueger. Google this week unveiled its own proposal to curtail tracking of users across apps on Android devices, potentially exacerbating Meta's challenges. ""Facebook has known for some time that they operated at the whim of the platforms on which consumers access their app,"" said Ari Paparo, an advertising-technology executive who sold his company to Comcast Corp. ""And now those platforms are changing the rules, and there's little they can do about it."" Meta has said that macroeconomic forces including inflation and supply-chain disruption also are putting pressure on ad spending. But the privacy push appears to be the biggest threat to the social-media giant's once ironclad grip on ad spending by small online businesses and e-commerce companies. Investor fears about the fallout from Apple's change are one of the reasons that Meta's market value has dropped by more than $300 billion since the recent earnings report. Facebook has been trying to blunt the effects of the Apple changes, and some analysts are optimistic that Meta will contain the damage and that its business could begin to rebound in the second half of 2022. Meta said in a written statement that it has more than 10 million advertisers. ""Apple's harmful policy is making it harder and more expensive for businesses of all sizes to reach their customers,"" it said. ""We believe Facebook and Instagram remain the best platforms for businesses to grow and connect with people, and we'll always keep working to improve performance and measurement."" Meta has been working to show advertisers that ads on Facebook and Instagram are driving more sales than its analytics show. And the company is developing new technology it hopes will give marketers nearly as much information about ad performance as they had before Apple's changes. Meta also has appealed to users to opt into device tracking. But data from app analytics provider Flurry shows that only 18% of U.S. users are choosing to do so across all apps. Meta has rolled out more e-commerce features within Facebook and Instagram so that more transactions happen within its own ecosystem. Apple's change could be the most disruptive innovation Meta ever faces, said analyst Daniel Newman of Futurum Research, which focuses on digital technology. ""Facebook has built its empire on the ability to acquire intimate details about user behavior across the internet,"" he said. ""Apple has changed the game."" Meta's big investment in the metaverse is an attempt to create a future in which it is not beholden to other device-makers, some ad industry executives said. Meta has been critical of Apple's move, saying it would hurt not only its revenue, but also small-business advertisers and app makers, and that Apple has created a false trade-off between personalized services and privacy. Inside Meta, some employees saw Apple's change, and Google's move in the same direction, as efforts to damage Meta's business, according to a former employee of Meta's ad-product division familiar with internal discussions. On Meta's Feb. 2 earnings call, Chief Financial Officer David Wehner criticized Apple and Google for contributing to its ad business's struggles and suggested that Apple's changes had benefited Google. He noted that Google pays billions of dollars to Apple annually to be the default search engine on iPhones. Meta has struck a more positive tone about Google's proposal to limit tracking, which isn't expected to go into effect for at least two years. Brows by Bossy, an eyebrow stencil maker, used to spend up to $7,000 a day on Facebook ads. As Apple's changes rolled out, ad prices ""started increasing, tracking was clearly not accurate any longer and the performance decreased,"" said Amanda Siebert, co-founder of the e-commerce company. She said the company slashed its Facebook spending by about 80% and shifted money elsewhere, including to Amazon search ads. Ath Sport, a company that makes and sells nutritional supplements for athletes, used to acquire a new customer for every $40 it spent on Facebook and Instagram ads. In summer 2021, that cost doubled, said Ath Sport owner Stuart Kam. Ath Sport cut its spending on Facebook ads and started spending 60% of its total marketing budget on Google search ads, which were more effective, he said. As companies like his spend more on Google, he said, the prices to advertise there are rising. Advertising industry executives said marketers began to think more about moving money away from Facebook back in the summer of 2020, before Apple's change. In the aftermath of the George Floyd murder, some brands temporarily boycotted Facebook over concerns about hate speech and faulty information on the platform. The ad executives said that was an inflection point for many companies who felt they had become too reliant on Facebook. ""It was a learning for everyone to understand that things could change. You have to have a backup plan and you have to diversify,"" said Kate Black, vice president of social strategy at Horizon Next, an ad firm that works with e-commerce companies. The Apple change was a tipping point. Ms. Black said the majority of her firm's clients have begun to shift 10% to 15% of their Facebook spending to other platforms such as TikTok. Clients are saying ""let's test and learn and see what we can do on other social platforms,"" she said. ""In terms of reach and scale, Meta is still the biggest player in the space and will definitely continue to be for many years to come, but others are definitely growing."" Toilet-spray maker -Pourri, which has relied heavily on Meta during the pandemic to generate e-commerce sales, said during the second half of 2021 that its return on its ad spending on Facebook began to decline as ad prices increased. While Facebook and Instagram still account for the majority of -Pourri's ad spending, the Apple changes have caused the company to start ""looking into new advertising channels,"" said Suzy Batiz, -Pourri's founder and chief executive. The company said it is seeking to shift about 30% of its ad dollars from Meta to diversify its spending. It already has begun to move some of its Facebook spending to TikTok, Amazon search ads and digital ad offerings from retailers such as Walmart Inc. -Pourri spends roughly $10 million a year on digital advertising. Facebook's disclosure after its recent quarter that its number of users had declined for the first time is worrisome for advertisers, said Diana DiGuido, chief client officer of Tinuiti, a digital-marketing agency that works with consumer-products and e-commerce companies. Ms. DiGuido said some of her clients want to test TikTok and Snap more robustly to see whether they can reduce their spending on Facebook without hurting their businesses. The data squeeze from Apple's privacy measure has affected all digital ad players to some degree, but other companies have been more insulated from the impact than Facebook. Snap has relied on less data from across the web to target ads, and therefore it doesn't have as much work to do to compensate for the lost data, said Nii Ahene, Tinuiti's chief strategy officer. Snap posted a net profit of $22.6 million in the most recent quarter, after sales rose 42% from the year-ago period. Snap said earlier this month that its ad business has begun to recover from the Apple changes faster than it anticipated. Google serves up search ads to a user based on the keywords they enter. That differs from Facebook's effort to match ads to users based on its data and the targeting choices made by advertisers. Meta's chief financial officer said on the recent earnings call that he believed Google was somewhat shielded from the Apple change because it does a lot of business based on searches in desktop browsers, which weren't affected. That difference helped Google attract ad spending from e-commerce businesses, said digital-ad consultant Eric Seufert. Google's search-ad revenue increased 36% in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period, to $43.3 billion. Rivals have been working to snatch ad dollars away from Facebook, ad buyers said. Snap, Pinterest and TikTok increased incentives they offer to companies that make a significant commitment, such as free credits to use toward future ad buys. TikTok and Snap have tried to help brands repurpose Facebook ads so they work better on their platforms, the ad buyers said. 19 Feb 2022 Inside Facebook's $10 Billion Breakup With -2- TikTok has benefited from having lower ad pricing than Facebook, though the increased interest in the platform among advertisers might change that, said Mr. Ahene of Tinuiti. Just as Apple's changes made it harder to measure the effectiveness of Facebook ads on iPhones, Google's proposal could do the same when it comes to Facebook ads delivered to Android users. Google said it would give the industry substantial notice before ending its current system. The long timeline will give the ad industry time to prepare. Meta is navigating an unprecedented challenge to its advertising business, but not an unsolvable one, said Emad Hasan, former head of business marketing operations and analytics at Facebook and CEO of Retina AI, which helps brands target customers on social media. He said Meta can build new ad tools to find new ways to show marketers that their ads are performing well. ""Facebook knows that its way of measurement will have to change,"" he said. Women's handbag brand Hammitt worked with Measured Inc., a company that uses statistical modeling to estimate how well Facebook ads are performing. The official rates reported by Facebook are abysmal, said Hammitt founder Tony Drockton, but Measured's reports showed Hammitt's Facebook ads are nearly as effective as they were before the privacy changes took effect. As a result, Hammitt reduced its Facebook ad spending only slightly, from 50% of its total ad budget to 43%. Hammitt's total dollars spent on Facebook actually increased because the company boosted its overall ad budget. Facebook has said it has been undercounting how effectively its ads have worked for advertisers, and that it has recently made progress in solving the problem. Facebook's longer-term challenge is to shore up its ability to efficiently target ads at users. Rebuilding targeting systems with less data ""will be a several year process,"" said analyst Michael Nathanson. ""Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the strides Facebook is making on measurement, and believe this will feed into their targeting efforts longer-term."" , Patience Haggin at patience.haggin@wsj.com and Salvador Rodriguez at salvador.rodriguez@wsj.com This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (February 19, 2022).

Meta_Facebook,Meta Investors Cheer Result That Isn't as Bad as Feared,28 April 2022,The Wall Street Journal,777 words,0.9739,0.099,0.069,0.832,"Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. added more users than expected but posted its slowest revenue growth since going public a decade ago, as the company navigates growing competition and privacy headwinds for its advertising business. The user numbers were a surprise for the tech giant. In the wake of poor earnings results from other digital-ad rivals earlier this week, investors had feared the worst, and on Wednesday they pushed Meta shares up more than 18% after results were announced. The company cited the war in Ukraine as a contributor to the revenue slowdown, among other factors. Meta's stock price was battered in February when it posted quarterly results that showed a sharper-than-expected decline in profits, a gloomy revenue outlook and a dip in its daily active users. Before Wednesday, Meta shares had fallen nearly 44% and the company had lost nearly $400 billion in market value. Meta executives including Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg cited on Wednesday several efforts to reverse those trends. To combat rival TikTok, which Mr. Zuckerberg has described as a rising threat, the company said it would more actively use artificial intelligence to recommend content to users from around the social network, as opposed to populating their feeds mostly with posts from friends and family. That in effect means Facebook will function more like TikTok's For You feed, which serves users content based on their interests as determined by the company's algorithm, not the accounts they follow. Meta had previously expanded the availability of its own short-form video format, known as Reels. Mr. Zuckerberg said the company's artificial intelligence will serve as a ""discovery engine that can show you all of the most interesting content that people have shared across our system."" One highlight for Meta was its Reality Labs unit, which is central to its long-term plans. Reality Labs develops VR headsets, AR glasses and virtual worlds, known as the metaverse, in which users can live and work. The unit's revenue came in at $695 million, ahead of the $683 million analysts were expecting. The unit lost nearly $3 billion, up from $1.8 billion a year prior as the company ramps up its investments in those areas. Analysts had been expecting a loss of $3.6 billion. The company has warned that building the metaverse would take many billions of dollars and several years of work but Mr. Zuckerberg said that level of investment will start to slow. He said Horizon Worlds, which is a virtual-reality world of legless avatars, will be the centerpiece of the company's metaverse strategy. The company plans to launch a web version of Horizon Worlds later this year in an effort to grow user adoption of the service, Mr. Zuckerberg said. Meta's advertising revenue for the first quarter was $27.9 billion, up 6.6% compared to a year prior. Analysts had predicted Meta's advertising revenue would rise to $28.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022. The revenue growth marked the lowest pace since the company went public in 2012, signaling the impact that ad-tracking changes introduced by Apple Inc. last year have had on its advertising business. The company had warned that those changes would cost Meta some $10 billion in 2022. Meta reported net income of $7.5 billion, compared with analysts' expectations of $7.1 billion. Facebook's user base grew to 1.96 billion daily active users, up from 1.93 billion reported in February. Analysts had expected Meta to report an uptick in Facebook's daily users to 1.95 billion. In the prior quarter, Facebook's daily active user base fell by two million users, which was the first time the company had reported a decline in users. Meta also forecast that it is expecting revenue between $28 billion and $30 billion for the second quarter, shy of the $30.7 billion expected by analysts, according to FactSet. Meta's earnings indicate continued turbulence for the digital-ad business. Social media rival Snap Inc. posted its first-quarter results last week, showing that its business is continuing to feel the sting from Apple's privacy changes.

Meta Platforms Inc. has begun telling publishers in the U.S. that it won't renew contracts to feature their content in its Facebook News tab, according to people familiar with the matter, phasing out deals that paid some outlets tens of millions of dollars. The decision affects deals worth over $100 million, according to a person familiar with the situation. Meta had signed up a host of publishers in recent years, including deals worth tens of millions of dollars with news organizations such as The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post, the Journal has reported. In June, the Journal reported that Meta was beginning to signal to publishers and others in the industry that renewing the deals wasn't a priority. Earlier this month, the Journal reported that Facebook had reallocated resources from its News tab platform to focus more on the creator economy, citing an internal company memo. Axios reported earlier Facebook's decision not to renew payments. ""A lot has changed since we signed deals three years ago to test bringing additional news links to Facebook News in the U.S.,"" said a Facebook spokeswoman. ""Most people do not come to Facebook for news, and as a business it doesn't make sense to overinvest in areas that don't align with user preferences,"" she said. The Facebook News tab will remain as a feature. While payments to U.S. publishers are being phased out, deals in countries such as the U.K., France, Germany and Australia will remain in place. 28 Jul 2022 Facebook to End Payments to U.S. News Publishers By Alexandra Bruell Meta Platforms Inc. has begun telling publishers in the U.S. that it won't renew contracts to feature their content in its Facebook News tab, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Facebook News tab will remain as a feature. While payments to U.S. publishers are being phased out, deals in countries such as the U.K., France, Germany and Australia will remain in place. Meta posted its first-ever decline in quarterly sales this week. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has been working urgently to revamp the tech giant's operations, from the content that is presented to users, to how digital ads are delivered, to focusing more on video content. Facebook announced the launch of Facebook News in 2019. At the time, publishers were growing increasingly frustrated that Facebook and Alphabet Inc.'s Google were taking the lion's share of the digital ad market. The person familiar with the situation said Facebook viewed its foray into news as an experiment that ultimately didn't pay off. Facebook's shift away from its paid news product was influenced by the stepping up of regulation around the world aiming to require technology platforms such as Facebook to pay for news, the Journal has reported. Some news outlets had already planned their budgets for the coming year without including the fees, according to publishing executives. Campbell Brown, a former journalist who leads Facebook's global media partnerships, said in the internal memo earlier this month that the company would shift engineering and product support away from the news tab and its Bulletin newsletter platform as ""those teams heighten their focus on building a more robust Creator economy."" Reallocating resources from News and Bulletin is part of a broader shift within the company toward the metaverse and short-form video content creators that can compete with ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok.

Meta_Facebook,Facebook Feels $10 Billion Sting From Apple's Privacy Push -- WSJ,3 February 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,789 words",0.983,0.087,0.054,0.859,"English , Inc. Facebook's parent company served up the starkest sign yet of how Apple Inc.'s new ad-privacy policy is roiling the digital-advertising world. Discussing Meta Platforms Inc.'s quarterly earnings and its outlook for the current year that shocked investors, Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner on Wednesday said the company expects the Apple policy to cost it more than $10 billion in lost sales for 2022. That is equivalent to about 8% of its total revenue last year. ""It's a pretty significant headwind,"" Mr. Wehner said on a call with analysts. Apple introduced the changes last April, altering its iPhone software to require apps to ask users whether they want to be tracked. The move seriously limited the ability to gather data through apps that is used to target digital ads and drove advertisers to alter spending patterns. Meta had said previously that the Apple move was hurting its ad business, but hadn't given an estimate for how much. Meta ""was impacted significantly and it's going to be a continuous problem,"" Daniel Newman, a principal analyst at Futurum Research, said Wednesday. The guidance was part of a quarterly report that raised multiple concerns for investors and sent Meta's shares plunging more than 20% in after-hours trading -- the equivalent of a $175 billion-plus loss in market capitalization. Meta also reported losing about a million daily users globally in the last quarter, and its sales outlook for the current quarter fell short of Wall Street expectations. The company expects expenses to jump around $20 billion or more this year as it pursues Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's bet on the metaverse, the online virtual world some see as the next evolution of the internet. The gloomy outlook also tainted investor sentiment on other ad-focused companies.

Snap is expected to provide more insight on how its business has been affected when it reports quarterly results after the bell Thursday. The stock was down more than 17% in premarket trading. Booming digital ad spending has been a boon for Mr. Zuckerberg's company. Facebook, as the company was known before its renaming last year to Meta, enjoyed years of strong revenue driven in significant part by its ability to track the behavior of users of apps and websites and enable advertisers to deliver highly targeted ads based on that information. The Apple policy change disrupted that ability, with a large majority of users, according to some measurements, opting not to be tracked. Meta says that policy has made ad targeting more difficult and measuring the impact of placements harder. Apple's move has had reach beyond social-media companies. Videogame company Zynga Inc., which specializes in smartphone games like Words With Friends and has its own advertising platform, suffered an earnings hit from the new Apple policy that led its shares to drop sharply last year. The company ended up selling itself to Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. for $11 billion last month. While there clearly is an impact from Apple's policy, Brian Wieser, GroupM's president of business intelligence, said the impact on Meta might not be as great as the company's executives have suggested. ""I'm skeptical that it's as bad as they're conveying,"" he said. The digital ad business remains healthy, he said, pointing to Google parent Alphabet Inc.'s strong earnings this week seemingly largely unaffected by the policy changes. Twitter, in its most recent earnings report in October, said it expected to be largely unaffected by the Apple policy because it isn't as reliant on targeted digital ads as some of its rivals. Meta's CFO, Mr. Wehner, said Apple's policy treats Google differently, suggesting that the difference might reflect a longstanding business relationship between the two companies. ""We believe Google's search ad business could have benefited relative to services like ours that face a different set of restrictions from Apple and given that Apple continues to take billions of dollars a year from Google search ads, the incentive clearly sits for this policy discrepancy to continue.""

Meta_Facebook,"Meta Employees, Security Guards Fired for Hijacking User Accounts",17 November 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,252 words",0.6808,0.056,0.046,0.898,"English , Inc. Meta Platforms Inc. has fired or disciplined more than two dozen employees and contractors over the last year whom it accused of improperly taking over user accounts, in some cases allegedly for bribes, according to people familiar with the matter and documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Some of those fired were contractors who worked as security guards stationed at Meta facilities and were given access to the Facebook parent’s internal mechanism for employees to help users having trouble with their accounts, according to the documents and people familiar with the matter. The mechanism, known internally as “Oops,” has existed since Facebook’s early years as a means for employees to help users they know who have forgotten their passwords or emails, or had their accounts taken over by hackers. As part of the alleged abuse of the system, Meta says that in some cases workers accepted thousands of dollars in bribes from outside hackers to access user accounts, the people and documents say. The disciplinary actions are part of a lengthy internal probe led by Meta executives, according to the documents and one of the people. “Individuals selling fraudulent services are always targeting online platforms, including ours, and adapting their tactics in response to the detection methods that are commonly used across the industry,” said Meta spokesman Andy Stone. He added that the company “will keep taking appropriate action against those involved in these kinds of schemes.” A spokeswoman for Meta’s security contractor, Allied Universal, said it “takes seriously all reports of violations of our standards of conduct.” The firings and disciplinary measures illustrate the vast and complicated problem Meta has supporting more than 3 billion users across its platforms with virtually no customer service, a function the company has said that it is committed to building out in the coming years. When people are locked out of their accounts, they typically try automated methods for resetting them or try to reach someone at Meta by phone or email, which many users have reported is often fruitless. Some of those people are able to get Meta employees and contractors to fill out a form through the Oops channel as a method of last resort. Oops, an acronym for Online Operations, is supposed to be fairly limited to special cases, like friends, family, business partners and public figures, but its usage has climbed along with employee head count. In 2020, the channel serviced about 50,270 tasks, up from 22,000 three years earlier, according to an internal by the Journal. To file an Oops report, the employee or contractor lists an email address that they would like to associate with the Facebook or Instagram account being reset. They must also answer a series of questions—indicating, for example, if the request is being made for someone on CEO Mark Zuckerberg‘s team, a celebrity, a family member or a Meta partner, according to documents viewed by the Journal. The request is then routed to Meta’s community support team. Because so many people depend on social media for their businesses, or to manage critically important aspects of their lives, gaining illicit control of an account can be lucrative. Stolen Facebook and Instagram handles can be sold for tens of thousands of dollars on other online forums. But in part because the Oops system is off limits to the vast majority of Facebook users, a cottage industry of intermediaries has developed who charge users money to regain control of their accounts. In interviews with the Journal, some of those third parties claim to have access to Meta employees to help reset accounts. “When you take someone’s Instagram account down that they’ve spent years building up, you’re taking away their whole means of generating an income,” says Nick McCandless, whose company McCandless Group operates a platform for content creators. Mr. McCandless says he charges his clients to reset accounts, sometimes through a contact he declined to name at Meta. “You really have to have someone on the inside who will actually do it,” he said. Brooke Millard, an Orange County-based model with about 650,000 Instagram followers, paid about $7,000 to Mr. McCandless to retrieve her account, after she couldn’t access it for reasons she didn’t understand in December 2021. She said she didn’t ask much about his process. “I knew obviously it wasn’t him that was doing something,” she said. “He obviously had a connection.” Mr. Stone, the Meta spokesman, said buying or selling accounts or paying for an account recovery service is a violation of the social network’s terms of service. Meta is also investigating some former employees for remaining in contact with other workers, allegedly to hijack user accounts. In July, an attorney on behalf of Meta sent a letter to one former security contractor who was fired in 2021, Kendel Melbourne, alleging that he assisted “third parties to fraudulently take control over Instagram accounts,” including after he left the company, according to a copy of the letter. Meta demanded Mr. Melbourne provide a detailed list of user accounts he had attempted to reset and the money he made doing so. In the July letter, Meta accused Mr. Melbourne of violating the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and said he has been banned from Facebook and Instagram. Mr. Melbourne worked at Allied Universal, where security guards were given login credentials to Facebook’s intranet, according to documents and people familiar with the matter. Although it wasn’t covered in training, that access included the ability to request account resets via the company’s internal Oops system. In an interview, Mr. Melbourne described Oops as a perk of the job. “They didn’t have any set of rules or give you a class on what to expect,” Mr. Melbourne said. In an email response to the Meta attorney, Mr. Melbourne denied committing fraud and said he reset about 20 accounts on behalf of friends, family and people he trusted. “Unfortunately I have fell [sic] victim to thinking I was helping people retrieve their accounts,” he said in the response to the attorney. “I will take responsibility for that.” Meta employees and contractors are given some training on how to use Oops as part of onboarding to the company, and anytime someone files a task in the Oops channel, the system warns employees to be wary of phishing attempts. Another Allied Universal contractor, Reva Mandelowitz, was fired in February after an internal investigation found that she allegedly reset multiple user accounts on behalf of hackers, receiving thousands of dollars in bitcoin for her services, according to people familiar with the matter and documents viewed by the Journal. In an interview, Ms. Mandelowitz denied wrongdoing, saying she requested about 20 account resets for friends and family. An unknown person reached out to her online and asked her to do more account resets in January, and then began a campaign of harassment when she refused to cooperate, she said. Lately, Allied has cracked down on its employees’ use of internal systems, warning in a recent internal message viewed by the Journal “DO NOT use the Meta OOPS platform.” —Salvador Rodriguez and Jim Oberman contributed to this article. and Robert McMillan at robert.mcmillan@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires November 17, 2022 (15:20 GMT)"
Meta_Facebook,Meta-morphosis or More Pain? Possible Futures for Facebook's Parent Company -- WSJ,11 June 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"2,271 words",0.3904,0.07,0.052,0.878,"English , Inc. It wasn't that long ago that Facebook seemed to be riding high -- with its ad-driven money machine still humming and a valuation that, as recently as September, topped $1 trillion. Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, is today the poster child of the tech reckoning. And, more so than its fellow tech giants, Meta's fate in the long run is anyone's guess. Which makes it an interesting time to ponder how much longer its travails will last, and what it might look like on the other side. While the shares of all tech companies have been hammered lately, the underlying profit machines for Apple, Microsoft, Google and Amazon suggest that they will weather the current economic, regulatory, and other challenges. Meta, on the other hand, seems to be genuinely threatened in the near term by several factors that could hurt its revenue and reach. The first is aggressive regulation -- new and pending, from the Federal Trade Commission and the European Union, and perhaps even Congress. The second is the impact on its advertising model of Apple's privacy changes -- and the prospect that Google might be following Apple's example for its Android mobile operating system. The third is the rapid growth of TikTok, as well as a handful of other growing competitors that are siphoning away Facebook's youngest users and challenging it for the attention of its older ones. And the fourth is that Meta is making a huge bet -- to the tune of nearly $10 billion in R&D a year -- on building an entirely new business for itself, the metaverse, that might not pan out. It's not as if Meta's competitors aren't facing some of the same challenges -- Google, especially, is facing even more heat from regulators than Facebook. But no other company of its size is facing so many challenges at once. What this all means, in the parlance of futurists -- the kind who teach at universities and are employed by Fortune 500 companies -- is that the "" cone of possibility"" for Meta's future is unusually broad, compared with tech companies of comparable size. Exploring the range of possible outcomes for Meta matters a great deal, not just for its investors and the tens of millions of businesses that rely on the company's services to reach their customers, but also for the billions of people who use them. At one extreme of Meta's cone of possibility, the company continues to bleed users, attention and revenue. Then, the final insult, the metaverse it is betting its future on is built by Apple instead, and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's big pivot fails. Eventually, the company is absorbed by a rival, maybe ByteDance, TikTok's parent. (I realize this sounds highly improbable, but proper futuring is about considering all possibilities.) At the other extreme of all possible futures for Meta, and one that seems more likely, is that Meta manages to muddle through its pivot to become primarily a metaverse company, after all. Sure, it won't be perfect. After a dip in revenue, it might take many years for Meta to match what it was able to generate by manipulating its users into using Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp as much as possible, harvesting the resulting attention, and selling it to advertisers. The metaverse represents an opportunity for Facebook to make money in new ways that aren't primarily about advertising. Meta on the skids Before we go more into Meta's future, a quick refresher on its present. In some ways, it's a grim picture. Apple's move last year to limit how smartphone data can be used to target ads has hammered Meta's core business model just as economic and geopolitical uncertainty have broadly hurt the digital-advertising sector. That all led to Meta's reporting revenue growth in the first quarter that was its slowest since its stock-market debut in 2012. Meta has estimated that the Apple change will cost it $10 billion in lost revenue in 2022 alone. Overall user growth for its family of apps has essentially plateaued, and daily users of its mainstay Facebook app actually declined in the final quarter of last year. Chief Financial Officer David Wehner recently suggested that user growth for that core ""blue"" app may be over, and that number will bounce around its current plateau of around two billion people from quarter to quarter. All that has driven its stock down by over half in the past nine months -- a far steeper decline than the tech sector broadly. And there is ample evidence that these headwinds will only intensify. Google has said it will roll out privacy changes similar to Apple's that could further reduce Meta's access to the personal data of approximately three of every four smartphone users in the world. Given that Apple's privacy changes have pushed ad delivery through Facebook toward Android devices, Google's changes could be especially troubling for Meta's future revenue. Meanwhile, TikTok is siphoning away young people, Meta's most valuable demographic -- and the one most important for its future. In 2020 TikTok surpassed Facebook in the number of minutes its users spend with the app each day, according to App Annie, which gathers data about consumers' mobile-app usage. Around the same time TikTok became the most downloaded app on the planet, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower. TikTok's ad business is just getting going, but by the end of 2022 it is projected to be bigger than Snapchat's and Twitter's combined, and to catch up to YouTube's in 2024, according to projections by Insider Intelligence. And yet a Pew survey found that in 2021 TikTok had less than a third of the U.S. users that Facebook did. Collectively, these trends indicate that on both the revenue and user side, TikTok has both tremendous momentum and room to grow. Given the state of the U.S. economy, that revenue growth is likely to come at the expense of other digital media giants, especially Facebook. Against the backdrop of all this concerning news, it appears Meta's pivot to the metaverse, while already under way, won't be completed any time soon. Mr. Zuckerberg has said the company's metaverse projects will be in the red for up to 5 years, and that some of the technology required to realize his vision could take 10 to 15 years. Because many of us have lived through the unprecedented rise of new technologies like the PC, the internet, and smartphones, we've grown accustomed to thinking that the gap between hearing about some new tech and having it in our hands is short. But that's generally not how big shifts to transformative new technologies work, says Andrew Bosworth, chief technology officer of Meta and head of its VR and metaverse-focused Reality Labs. Making a virtual- or augmented-reality system people are comfortable wearing for long periods, and which is ultimately no more cumbersome than a pair of eyeglasses, he adds, ""is as hard a problem as our industry has tackled in 60 years."" Uncertain future As part of its efforts to continue growing, Meta recently started distributing its AI engineers to product teams, rather than centralizing them all in a research lab. While AI is relevant to any number of things the company does, ad targeting remains an important one. Facebook's ability to micro-target ads -- which can make it seem like our phones are listening to us even when they aren't -- depends not just on how much data the company can gather on us, but its ability to use AI to match us to other consumers like us. Other efforts by Meta include pushing advertisers to build shops within Instagram and Facebook. This effort is in its early days, and some retailers have complained about the results. Retail that happens within Meta's own sites and apps helps the company to gather the data its AI needs to target ads and complete sales, making up for data lost to device-makers' privacy changes. Meta's costly investment in new virtual- and mixed-reality headsets -- that is, ones that combine VR and the real world -- will yield many new opportunities to gather data on us, and could even allow even more efficient ad targeting, says Amy Webb, an author, professor at NYU's Stern School of Business and a self-described ""quantitative futurist."" If people are using a Meta-built headset, the company can't be blocked by either Google or Apple from gathering all the user data the law allows. What's more, a headset -- which can do everything from recognizing our body language and posture to tracking our eyes and listening to our voice -- would grant Meta an unprecedented amount of information about not just where we are and what we're doing, but also our moment-to-moment emotional state, adds Ms. Webb. ""We are committed to notifying the users any time a new kind of data or sensor will be used,"" says Mr. Bosworth. The company is also trying to do as much processing of sensor data on its headsets as possible, rather than sending data to the cloud, which places inherent limitations on how it can be used, he adds. (Apple has touted a similar strategy as a way for it to protect privacy by, for example, processing voice requests to Siri on the iPhone, rather than sending them through the internet.) With such information, Meta would be able to advertise to us in ways more subtle -- and potentially more sinister -- than anything we've yet experienced, says Philip Rosedale, founder of Linden Lab, the company that built the original metaverse, Second Life. ""In a metaverse, you don't know where the ads are anymore,"" says Mr. Rosedale. ""In the real world they're in squares, they're in rectangles, you can choose to ignore them. That's not true in a metaverse. The ad is that person across the street, who isn't necessarily a real person; they're an ad."" It's still early days for the company in terms of determining how advertising might work in the metaverse, says Mr. Bosworth. He thinks the industry is ""getting ahead of itself"" by trying to figure this out now. 11 Jun 2022 Meta-morphosis or More Pain? Possible Futures for Facebook's Parent Company -- WSJ -2- In many of the same ways television advertising has proven so effective, ads that surround us and with which we might interact without even knowing it could be that much more effective. What's more, all the biometric data gathered by a headset could rapidly tell Meta's systems things like your sexual orientation and your mental health status, and sell that information to an advertiser, adds Mr. Rosedale. Meta stopped allowing advertisers to explicitly target users by ""sensitive"" topics like sexual or political orientation in November 2021. But the company's powerful ""lookalike audiences"" feature uses AI to target people on Facebook who match the demographics, interests and behaviors of people an advertiser has already identified as among its target audience. As with advertising formats, Meta is also still early in its process of figuring out which kinds of data gathered by headsets are useful for targeting advertising, says Mr. Bosworth. It's not clear to him that unconscious behaviors are as valuable as conscious ones for that purpose, he adds. Beyond ads, there is early evidence Facebook is trying to figure out how to make money from the metaverse in other ways. For example, Meta recently said that it could charge content creators in its metaverse up to 47.5% of the sale price of virtual goods sold through its new sales platform, which it introduced in April. Mr. Bosworth took pains to distinguish between what the company charges for apps sold in its VR app store, where it takes a 30% cut, and what it charges for sales within its metaverse, which can be accessed through apps purchased from its VR store or elsewhere. So, for example, if someone accessed Meta's metaverse through a web browser or a mobile device instead of a Meta-built VR headset -- the ability to do so is forthcoming -- then something sold in its metaverse would only be subject to an in-metaverse 25% sales fee. Another model Meta has yet to try but which is enormously popular in competing metaverses is selling virtual real estate. Second Life, which doesn't make money from advertising, has for years generated most of its revenue from a roughly $20-a-month property tax on each virtual acre, says Mr. Rosedale. At this point, Meta isn't interested in trying to make money from virtual real estate, says Mr. Bosworth. Even if Apple wins the war for which headset comes to dominate the market, Meta still has ample opportunity to make money from its metaverse. Just as the iPhone supercharged Meta's growth back when it was called Facebook, a stylish and user-friendly VR or AR headset from Apple could prove to be the perfect delivery device for a metaverse-based social network brought to you by -- who else, really? -- Meta.

Facebook announced the launch of Facebook News in 2019. At the time, publishers were growing increasingly frustrated that Facebook and Alphabet Inc.'s Google were taking the lion's share of the digital ad market. Facebook has paid publishers who participate in the News program. The company signed deals worth tens of millions of dollars with news organizations such as The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and the Washington Post, the Journal reported. But as these deals approached their expiration dates this year, Facebook began to signal to publishers and others in the industry that renewing the deals wasn't a priority, the Journal reported. Facebook's shift away from its paid news product was influenced by the stepping up of regulation around the world aiming to require technology platforms such as Facebook to pay for news, according to people familiar with the matter. That reduced Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's enthusiasm for making news a bigger part of Facebook's offerings, the people said. Reallocating resources from News and Bulletin is part of a broader shift within the company toward the metaverse and short-form video content creators that can compete with ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok. Ms. Brown, who as Facebook's longtime news partnerships chief was the original architect of Facebook's strategy of paying for news, was recently promoted to a broader role overseeing all media partnerships, including film and sports. Facebook unveiled Bulletin last year, looking to capitalize on the newsletter boom with a platform that let journalists and other independent writers keep all of their subscription revenue. At the beginning, Facebook offered multiyear licensing deals to give writers time to build up their subscriber bases, launching with high-profile names such as former CNN correspondent Jessica Yellin, sports broadcaster Erin Andrews and author Malcolm Gladwell. 19 Jul 2022 Correction to Article About Facebook's Paid News Products Campbell Brown leads Facebook's global media partnerships.

Meta_Facebook,Business/Financial Desk; SECTB,4 February 2022,The New York Times,"1,317 words",0.1303,0.072,0.064,0.864,"6 English .  The company formerly known as Facebook has hit major turbulence as it suffered its biggest one-day wipeout ever. Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, suffered its biggest one-day wipeout ever on Thursday as its stock plummeted 26 percent and its market value plunged by more than $230 billion. Its crash followed a dismal earnings report on Wednesday, when Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, laid out how the company was navigating a tricky transition from social networking toward the so-called virtual world of the metaverse. On Thursday, a company spokesman reiterated statements from its earnings announcement and declined to comment further. Here are six reasons that Meta is in a difficult spot. User growth has hit a ceiling. The salad days of Facebook's wild user growth are over. Even though the company on Wednesday recorded modest gains in new users across its so-called family of apps -- which includes Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp -- its core Facebook social networking app lost about half a million users over the fourth quarter from the previous quarter. That's the first such decline for the company in its 18-year history, during which time it had practically been defined by its ability to bring in more new users. The dip signaled that the core app may have reached its peak. Meta's quarterly user growth rate was also the slowest it has been in at least three years. Meta's executives have pointed to other growth opportunities, like turning on the money faucet at WhatsApp, the messaging service that has yet to generate substantial revenue. But those efforts are nascent. Investors are likely to next scrutinize whether Meta's other apps, such as Instagram, might begin to hit their top on user growth. Apple's changes are limiting Meta. Last spring, Apple introduced an ''App Tracking Transparency'' update to its mobile operating system, essentially giving iPhone owners the choice as to whether they would let apps like Facebook monitor their online activities. Those privacy moves have now hurt Meta's business and are likely to continue doing so. Now that Facebook and other apps must explicitly ask people for permission to track their behavior, many users have opted out. That means less user data for Facebook, which makes targeting ads -- one of the company's main ways of making money -- more difficult. Doubly painful is that iPhone users are a far more lucrative market to Facebook's advertisers than, say, Android app users. People who use iPhones to access the internet typically spend more money on products and apps served up to them from mobile ads. Meta said on Wednesday that Apple's changes would cost it $10 billion in revenue over the next year. The company has railed against Apple's shifts and said they are bad for small businesses that rely on advertising on the social network to reach customers. But Apple is unlikely to reverse its privacy changes and Meta's shareholders know it. Google is stealing online advertising share. Meta's troubles have been its competitors' good fortune. On Wednesday, David Wehner, Meta's chief financial officer, noted that as Apple's changes have given advertisers less visibility into user behaviors, many have started shifting their ad budgets to other platforms. Namely Google. In Google's earnings call this week, the company reported record sales, particularly in its e-commerce search advertising. That was the very same category that tripped up Meta in the last three months of 2021. Unlike Meta, Google is not heavily dependent on Apple for user data. Mr. Wehner said it was likely that Google had ''far more third-party data for measurement and optimization purposes'' than Meta's ad platform. Mr. Wehner also pointed to Google's deal with Apple to be the default search engine for Apple's Safari browser. That means Google's search ads tend to appear in more places, taking in more data that can be useful for advertisers. That's a huge problem for Meta in the long term, especially if more advertisers switch to Google search ads. TikTok and Reels present a conundrum. For more than a year, Mr. Zuckerberg has pointed to how formidable TikTok has been as a foe. The Chinese-backed app has grown to more than a billion users on the back of its highly shareable and strangely addictive short video posts. And it is fiercely competing with Meta's Instagram for eyeballs and attention. Meta has cloned TikTok with a video product feature called Instagram Reels. Mr. Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that Reels, which is prominently placed in people's Instagram feeds, was currently the No. 1 driver of engagement across the app. The problem is that while Reels may be attracting users, it doesn't make money as effectively as Instagram's other features, like Stories and the main feed. That's because it's slower to make money off video ads, since people tend to skip past them. That means the more that Instagram pushes people toward using Reels, the less money it may make on those users. Mr. Zuckerberg compared the situation to a similar time several years ago when Instagram introduced its Stories feature, which was a clone of Snapchat. That product also did not make as much money for the company when it debuted, though the ad dollars eventually followed. Still, there's no guarantee Instagram Reels can repeat that magic. Spending on the metaverse is bonkers. Mr. Zuckerberg believes so much that the internet's next generation is the metaverse -- a still fuzzy and theoretical concept that involves people moving across different virtual- and augmented-reality worlds -- that he is willing to spend big on it. So big that the spending amounted to more than $10 billion last year. Mr. Zuckerberg expects to spend even more in the future. Yet there is no evidence the bet will pay off. Unlike Facebook's shift to mobile devices in 2012, virtual reality use is still the province of niche hobbyists and has yet to really break into the mainstream. Widespread augmented-reality headsets are also months -- if not years -- away. In essence, Mr. Zuckerberg is asking employees, users and investors to have faith in him and his metaverse vision. That's a big ask for something that will cost the company billions in the coming years and that may never come to fruition. The specter of antitrust looms. The threat of regulators in Washington coming for Mr. Zuckerberg's company is a headache that just won't go away. Meta faces multiple investigations, including from a newly aggressive Federal Trade Commission and multiple state attorneys general, into whether it acted in an anti-competitive manner. Lawmakers have also coalesced around congressional efforts to pass antitrust bills. Mr. Zuckerberg has argued that Meta is not a social networking monopoly. He has pointed furiously to what he calls ''unprecedented levels of competition,'' including from TikTok, Apple, Google and other future opponents. But the threat of antitrust action has made it more difficult for Meta to buy its way into new social networking trends. In the past, Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp with little scrutiny as those services gained billions of users. Now even some of Meta's seemingly less contentious acquisitions in virtual reality and GIFs have been challenged by regulators globally. With deal-making less likely, the onus is on Meta to innovate its way out of any challenges. In the past, Mr. Zuckerberg might have been given the benefit of the doubt that he would be able to do so. But on Thursday at least, faith was in short supply on Wall Street. Mark Zuckerberg, the chairman and chief executive of , has placed a major bet on the metaverse.

Meta_Facebook,Meta has a new plan for payments,14 April 2022,American Banker,"1,097 words",0.9983,0.127,0.021,0.852,"English © 2022 Arizent.  Mark Zuckerberg — or rather, his avatar — excitedly extolled the potential of a virtual marketplace earlier this week on Meta video , giving the world a first glimpse of the company's plans for payments after it sold off the assets of its Diem stablecoin . The market may be virtual, but the money can be real. Meta (formerly Facebook) is testing a payment mechanism that will enable creators to sell virtual assets and other content on Horizon Worlds, which is Meta's virtual reality environment that launched in December. Its fees exceed those that Apple and Google charge for their app stores, so Facebook will have to convince developers that its virtual world is worth the price of admission. “The selling of virtual assets is a proven revenue model, so you can understand why Meta is testing it — particularly as the organization looks for new revenue streams that don’t rely on capturing customer data for advertising,"" said Danny Stefanic, CEO and founder of MootUp, a Phoenix-based virtual events platform. ""Users will build experiences in Horizon Worlds, and Meta will probably have the rights to remove their stuff too — and the best creators will bring the audience,"" Stefanic said. The model allows Meta to be the gatekeeper of its own ""metaverse"" while taking a cut of the revenue generated by others' efforts, according to Stefanic. Meta is planning to take a cut of more than 47% for metaverse sales, including a hardware platform fee of 30% for sales through the Meta Quest Store and a 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds. ""That’s a significant percentage and means you will need to sell a quarter more to get a full return,"" Stefanic said. In the video, Meta CEO Zuckerberg said the ability to sell virtual items and access to virtual worlds is a new part of e-commerce. Other potential moves include a new virtual currency, non fungible token sales and small-business lending, all areas of increasing interest to large payment companies. ""Meta could provide numerous services to sellers and others on its platform,"" said Daniel Keyes, an analyst at Javelin Strategy & Research in New York. ""It's not as strong as if [Facebook's] Diem were a success, but there is potential."" Since Meta debuted its VR headset, the Quest, the company has enabled a wide range of entertainment options that go beyond virtual gaming and social settings. Users can attend concerts, sporting events and stand-up comedy in virtual seats that are mixed in with the real crowd via a special camera set up at the live venue. Meta is additionally piloting an incentive program for creators in the U.S. Bonuses are tied to monthly programs in which creators are paid based on progress toward goals, such as time spent in virtual worlds. Meta may expand those goals over time to encourage creators to adopt new tools or features that Meta rolls out. Social tokens that are issued as incentive for contributions to Facebook groups and small business lending are also reportedly on the financial services menu at Meta. Other Meta initiatives include a virtual currency that would operate similar to an in-app token. The Financial Times reports the tokens would work similar to tokens in gaming apps such as the Robux tokens on Roblox, a popular online game. Roblox's revenue has expanded to $1.9 billion from $325 million over the past three years, according to Statista , suggesting the potential for income inside a self-contained virtual world. Facebook has struggled with virtual currencies in the past. The Diem stablecoin was subject to nonstop regulatory and political controversy and never came to market, though Silvergate Bank, which was part of the Diem project and purchased the assets from Facebook, does plan to launch a stablecoin. And an earlier virtual currency called Facebook Credits fizzled under low demand in the early 2010s. But that was before the success of Roblox and the maturation of the in-app purchasing economy. This revenue model is similar to that of stored-value accounts such as the Starbucks Card, which is the foundation of the coffee chain's successful mobile wallet. ""The easiest method to introduce a payment scheme is to implement a closed-loop solution. This eliminates the majority of banking regulations as the funds are kept by the company and are represented as a liability on their books,"" said Tim Sloane, vice president of payments innovation at Mercator Advisory Group in Concord, Massachusetts. Within a virtual environment these closed-loop funds can be used to purchase items and could also establish credit functions, Sloane said, In the virtual world the virtual currency could accomplish everything crypto does in the open environment, but with significantly less regulatory oversight. ""In 2014 I suggested the Bitcoin platform could be used to establish a closed loop gift card program , and it still could,"" Sloane said. Meta also plans a test of membership groups for NFT ownership and another test to mint NFTs, according to the Financial Times report. Zuckerberg said during this year's SXSW that Facebook's Instagram will soon support NFTs. The card networks and other payment companies are expanding support for NFTs , either as a processing rail for purchases, or as a means of fundraising or incentive marketing. And the metaverse is of growing interest to financial institutions. Banks such as JPMorgan Chase and HSBC are working on metaverse services, while American Express and Mastercard have filed metaverse-related patents. The metaverse could generate as much as $13 trillion in yearly revenue and have more than 5 billion users by 2030, according to Citigroup (""https://www.citivelocity.com/citigps/metaverse-and-money/""). In a statement from its public relations department, Meta said: ""We continuously consider new product innovations for people, businesses, and creators. As a company, we are focused on building for the metaverse and that includes what payments and financial services might look like.” Most of the pilot programs are designed to boost usage of existing and future Meta services. Meta is exploring “social tokens” or “reputation tokens,” which “could be issued as rewards for meaningful contributions in Facebook groups, for example,” according to the FT. The company is additionally developing traditional financial services such as small business loans. Instagram Shops and Facebook Shops would provide a potential market for small-business lending, Keyes said, adding the feature would be an alternative to fintech small business lending services such as PayPal, Square and Kabbage, rather than a direct competitor. ""Social commerce is a big deal, but Meta would exist alongside other options,"" Keyes said."
Meta_Facebook,Technology,21 June 2022,The Wall Street Journal Online,846 words,0.9965,0.131,0.055,0.814,"Corrections & Amplifications Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. agreed Tuesday to adopt new online advertising practices to settle an investigation by federal officials. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the company had agreed Thursday to adopt the new practices. (Corrected on June 21.) WASHINGTON—Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc . agreed Tuesday to adopt new online advertising practices to settle an investigation by federal officials, who said its ads discriminated against users by race, gender and other factors . In a filing in federal district court in New York, the Justice Department and federal housing officials said they would settle housing discrimination charges against Meta , with no admission of liability by the company, in exchange for Meta 's agreement to make changes to its advertising distribution systems. Facebook and its Ads * HUD Action Against Facebook Signals Trouble for Other Platforms (March 28, 2019) * Facebook Axes Age, Gender and Other Targeting for Some Sensitive Ads (March 19, 2019) * Facebook Restricts Ads Targeting Specific Ethnic Groups (Nov. 3, 2016) ""When a company develops and deploys technology that deprives users of housing opportunities based in whole or in part on protected characteristics, it has violated the Fair Housing Act,"" said a statement from U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. It is illegal to deny someone housing or employment based on federally protected characteristics such as race, religion and sex. The Justice Department said the settlement marks the first time that Meta will be subject to court oversight for its ad targeting and delivery system. ""Because of this ground-breaking lawsuit, Meta will—for the first time— change its ad delivery system to address algorithmic discrimination. But if Meta fails to demonstrate that it has sufficiently changed its delivery system to guard against algorithmic bias, this office will proceed with the litigation,"" Mr. Williams said. In a statement, Meta said that it also plans to change its ads related to employment and credit in addition to housing. ""Discrimination in housing, employment and credit is a deep-rooted problem with a long history in the U.S., and we are committed to broadening opportunities for marginalized communities in these spaces and others,"" Meta said. According to federal officials, Meta created an ad-targeting algorithm that would consider protected characteristics—including race, religion and sex—to find Facebook users who mirrored the advertiser's targeted audience. In addition, officials alleged, Meta 's ad delivery system has used algorithms that rely on protected characteristics to help determine which subset of an advertiser's targeted audience will actually receive the ad, and which won't. The ad targeting tool, originally known as ""Lookalike Audience,"" and later as ""Special Ad Audience"" used a machine-learning algorithm to find Facebook users who share similarities with groups of individuals selected by an advertiser using several options provided by Facebook , according to the Justice Department. Under the agreement, Meta must stop using the tool by Dec. 31 and has until that month to develop a new system for housing ads to address disparities for race, ethnicity and sex between advertisers' targeted audiences and the group of Facebook users to whom Facebook 's personalization algorithms actually deliver the ads, the Justice Department said. ""What we're trying to do is make sure that no one can say that our systems are in any way treating people differently on the basis of protected characteristics,"" said Roy Austin Jr., Meta 's vice president of civil rights. Meta also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $115,054, the maximum available under the Fair Housing Act, federal officials said. The government's complaint also raised concerns about how effective Meta 's efforts to date have been. ""Although Facebook has made some changes to the targeting options available for housing, credit, and employment ads, these changes have been insufficient to stop discriminatory ad targeting,"" the complaint says. ""In April 2021, advertisers were able to target credit ads using targeting options that Facebook had previously claimed were prohibited."" An antidiscrimination advocate praised the government's effort, but said more work remains to ensure fairness in the online world, where antidiscrimination rules haven't always kept pace with technological change. Peter Romer-Friedman, a lawyer with Gupta Wessler PLLC, called the settlement a ""ground-breaking achievement"" but said it doesn't address potential discrimination in advertising contexts outside the areas of housing, employment and credit. In a statement, Meta said that its new method ""strives to make additional progress toward a more equitable distribution of ads through our ad delivery process."" Meta added that it will build into its ad system a new feature ""designed to make sure the audience that ends up seeing a housing ad more closely reflects the eligible targeted audience for that ad.""

CFO Outlook Commentary We expect third quarter 2022 total revenue to be in the range of $26-28.5 billion. This outlook reflects a continuation of the weak advertising demand environment we experienced throughout the second quarter, which we believe is being driven by broader macroeconomic uncertainty. We also anticipate third quarter Reality Labs revenue to be lower than second quarter revenue. Our guidance assumes foreign currency will be an approximately 6% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth in the third quarter, based on current exchange rates. In addition, as noted on previous calls, we continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations. We expect 2022 total expenses to be in the range of $85-88 billion, lowered from our prior outlook of $87-92 billion. We have reduced our hiring and overall expense growth plans this year to account for the more challenging operating environment while continuing to direct resources toward our company priorities. We expect 2022 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $30-34 billion, narrowed from our prior range of $29-34 billion. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full-year 2022 tax rate to be above the second quarter rate and in the high teens.

We translated revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance. Purchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business.

Meta_Facebook,Mark Zuckerberg's Bid to Reinvent Facebook Parent Meta Gains New Urgency -- Update,28 July 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,187 words",0.998,0.115,0.012,0.872,"English , Inc. Mark Zuckerberg's efforts to remake Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is taking on a new sense of urgency after the company posted its first-ever quarter of falling sales and little sign of an upturn soon. To help stem the decline swiftly, Mr. Zuckerberg is trying to revamp almost every aspect of the social-media platform's operations, from what content is presented to users, to how digital advertising is delivered, to focusing more on video content. It all adds up to one of the biggest set of changes for the company in years, analysts say. ""Meta is at an inflection point -- what once seemed untouchable is showing cracks,"" said Daniel Newman, a principal analyst at Futurum Research. ""Meta has big problems to solve, and like it has done in the past, it needs to be swift to address them all the while dealing with the fiercest competition it has ever faced."" Facebook, as Meta was called before its rebranding last year, has gone through turmoil before. But adding to Mr. Zuckerberg's challenge is the economic backdrop against which this transformation is playing out. Soaring inflation is weighing on advertising spending and there is stiff competition among platforms for what ad dollars are out there. Ad prices that fell 8% in the first quarter, by Meta's calculation, were down 14% in the April through June period, the company said Wednesday as it reported quarterly results. A year ago, the company reported an increase of 47% year-over-year for its average price per ad. Mr. Zuckerberg, on an earnings call Wednesday, said ""we're focused on making the long-term investments that will position us to be stronger coming out of this downturn."" Shares in Meta were down more than 6% in Thursday trading. The stock has retreated more than 50% this year, erasing roughly $500 billion from its market valuation. The company also faces formidable competition. TikTok, the Chinese-owned social-media service, surpassed 1 billion monthly active users in September 2021, and its usage surpassed that of Meta's Instagram among teenagers in November 2021, according to Forrester Research Inc. To battle back, Meta launched Reels -- a short-form video service not unlike TikTok's -- for U.S. Instagram users in August 2020. More recently, Mr. Zuckerberg in April said that Facebook and Instagram would more actively use artificial intelligence to recommend content to users from accounts that they don't already follow. It is a drastic shift away from how Facebook and Instagram have traditionally operated, which is to show content to users from their friends, family or the accounts that they follow. Using an algorithm to determine what content a user is most likely to engage with is perhaps the most signature feature of TikTok. That was followed by an announcement in May from Instagram boss Adam Mosseri, who said that the service would begin testing showing full-screen photos and videos to users, similar to the layout of TikTok's app. Mr. Zuckerberg said the changes are showing promising early returns. On Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg said that over the past three months Meta saw a 30% increase in the time that users are engaging with Reels. He added that nearly one in six posts in users' Instagram and Facebook feeds come from accounts that users don't follow and are based on AI recommendations. That figure will rise to one in every three posts by the end of 2023, he said. ""I think we're on track here and we just need to push through this one,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said. But the changes have also created a popular revolt among some high-profile users. This week more than 2 million Instagram users liked a post that reads ""Make InstagramInstagram Again"" and ""stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends."" Among the users who shared the post were influential celebrities Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian. ""I need to be honest. I do believe that more of Instagram is going to become video over time,"" Mr. Mosseri said Tuesday. Mr. Zuckerberg addressed the backlash on the earnings call, saying that users will still see content from their friends but insisting that the changes will improve Facebook and Instagram. Hours later, the company, in a surprise move, withdrew some of the changes it had made recently. Instagram said it would pause a test version of the app that showed users full-screen photos and videos ""so we can explore other options."" It also said it would throttle back the number of posts shown to users from accounts that they don't follow. ""While we believe that Instagram needs to evolve as the world changes, we want to take the time to make sure we get this right,"" the company said in a written statement. The latest changes were reported earlier by Platformer, a tech newsletter. The social-media giant has navigated rough patches before. As it prepared to go public in 2012, Facebook, then still largely accessed on PCs, faced Wall Street questions about how it would deal with consumers shifting to mobile. The company responded by buying up Instagram for $1 billion and revamping its mobile apps. Facebook found itself in a similar quagmire in 2016 when it was locked in a fierce rivalry with Snap Inc., the maker of Snapchat. The company responded by launching Instagram Stories, a rival to its competitor's most notable feature. Mr. Zuckerberg will be pursuing the latest transformation without one of his closest compatriots. Sheryl Sandberg, who is credited with helping build Facebook into the ad juggernaut it became, is leaving the company and was on her last Meta earnings call Wednesday. Meta also is trying to push through changes while undergoing belt tightening. The company cut its forecast for expenses this year to a range of $85 billion to $88 billion, from an earlier projection of $87 billion to $92 billion. The company also will reduce its rate of hiring, he said, with some teams shrinking. ""This is a period that demands more intensity, and I expect us to get more done with fewer resources,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said. The co-founder last year unveiled new plans for the company as he renamed it Meta, principally around a push to embrace the so-called metaverse, a nascent, more immersive vision of the internet where people would interact. ""I still believe that these projects are important, but given the more recent revenue trajectory that we're seeing, we're slowing the pace of these investments and pushing some expenses that would have come in the next year or two off to a somewhat longer timeline,"" he said on the earnings call. ""Previously challenging periods have been transformational for our company and helped us develop our next generation of leaders, and I expect this period to be no different,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said.

Meta_Facebook,Facebook Parent Meta Details Human-Rights Efforts -- WSJ,14 July 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,795 words,-0.9843,0.043,0.091,0.866,"English , Inc. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. released its first annual report Thursday on the effect its services have on global human rights, highlighting its efforts to combat challenges including human trafficking, the spread of misinformation and attacks on election integrity. Facebook's global operations are drawing scrutiny from rights groups and regulators. While user growth has stalled in rich countries, it continues to expand internationally, especially in populous, developing markets. ""The point of having an annual report is it can be a predictable, reliable central source of information that people can expect and consult every year,"" Meta Director of Human Rights Miranda Sissons said. The company said last year it was adopting a policy for human-rights standards for its products, apps and overall businesses. It said it would begin publishing yearly reports on how it is tackling human-rights concerns related to its products. The report primarily recaps steps that Meta has taken since January 2020 to identify and address risks to human rights across its services. Ms. Sissons noted that Meta is among the few companies providing human-rights reports, and said it is still driving toward best practices for this type of disclosure. ""I am pretty sure that as this report develops year after year we'll also be able to include more forward-looking thinking and information,"" she said. Included as part of the report is a summary of an assessment of the risks that Meta's services pose to human rights in India, the company's largest market by customers and one where authorities have questioned executives about inflammatory content on its platform. Meta commissioned the assessment from the law firm Foley Hoag LLP, with the project launching in March 2020, according to Facebook. Ms. Sissons said Meta doesn't plan to release it in its entirety. Human-rights risks in India connected to Meta's services, according the summary, include restrictions of freedom of expression and information and third-party advocacy of hatred that incites hostility, discrimination or violence. Other risks include violations of rights to privacy and security of individuals and risks related to hateful and discriminatory speech by users. The report also mentions that the independent assessment noted allegations of bias in Meta's content moderation. The independent assessment's conclusions and recommendations ""are not statements made on behalf of or adopted by Meta,"" the report said. ""Meta is studying these findings, however, and will consider them as a baseline to identify and guide related actions."" As part of its Facebook Files project, The Wall Street Journal reported last year that scores of internal Facebook documents show employees have raised alarms about how its services are used in some developing countries. In many instances Facebook had responded in inadequate ways, if at all, the Journal reported. In India, home to more than 300 million Facebook users and more than 400 million users of Facebook's WhatsApp messaging service, internal documents said company products were awash with inflammatory content that one report linked to deadly religious riots, the Journal reported. Human-rights groups said last year that Facebook was stifling the human-rights-impact assessment it had commissioned, narrowing its scope and delaying its completion. A Facebook spokesman at the time said the company was dedicated to completing a thorough report, not meeting a particular deadline. Facebook's decision not to release the full assessment is ""deeply disappointing,"" said Ratik Asokan of India Civil Watch International, one of the organizations that provided input to Foley Hoag. In past years, Facebook acknowledged its slow response to a torrent of religious hate speech and misinformation on the platform in Myanmar. In a 2018 report, United Nations investigators called for prosecuting the country's military chief for his role in a military campaign the previous year that killed 10,000 members of the Rohingya minority and sent some 700,000 more fleeing across the border to Bangladesh. Facebook later released the full version of a human-rights-impact assessment it commissioned on its operations in Myanmar. It has released executive summaries of assessments it commissioned on its operations in Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Cambodia. Thursday's report includes an assessment of the risks posed by Meta's Ray-Ban Stories glasses, which went on sale last year and can record photos and videos. It cites the risk of bystanders' being recorded without their consent, safety risks for people wearing the glasses and privacy risks posed by new technology related to visual search and cloud storage of data. and Salvador Rodriguez at salvador.rodriguez@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires July 14, 2022 (13:00 GMT)"

Meta_Facebook,Science of Success,3 November 2022,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,485 words",-0.9484,0.11,0.124,0.766,"You know what's cool? A trillion dollars. That was the market capitalization of Facebook just over a year ago, right before the company decided to rename itself Meta. It has since declined by roughly $800 billion . Eight hundred billion dollars! That's more than the market cap of almost every company in the S&P 500. It's more than Exxon Mobil. It's more than Berkshire Hathaway. It's more than Tesla and a parking lot of Tesla cars. The recent tech selloff has shrunk Amazon, Alphabet and every giant but Apple, wiping out trillions of dollars across Silicon Valley with a brutal efficiency that only an engineer could appreciate. But no company looks as dismal these days as the one whose stock price is down 75% since last September. The good news for Meta is that many of the biggest losers in recent market history learned how to win again. The bad news for Meta is that it doesn't have much else in common with them. Many companies change strategies because they lost money. Meta is losing money because it changed strategies. It has been almost exactly one year since chief executive and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg made the bold maneuver of rebranding Facebook as Meta Platforms because he believed the future of the company was not in social media but the immersive, amorphous online realm known as the metaverse . The decision to place so much faith in such an unproven premise will go down as one of the riskiest bets any corporation has ever made, no matter what happens next. But what's happening now is bleak. It's still not clear what might count as success, only that Meta is nowhere close to it—and the company has gone about getting there in the wrong way. ""You want to take big problems and break them down so that you have small wins and small losses,"" said Sim Sitkin, the Michael W. Krzyzewski distinguished professor in leadership at Duke University. I called Dr. Sitkin because he wrote a scholarly paper a few decades ago about this strategy of small losses and coined a term for it: ""intelligent failure."" The evaporation of $800 billion in market value was not particularly smart by his standard, which is useful for thinking about Meta and other tech companies because of the nature of their businesses. Innovation requires experimentation. Experiments fail. Failure can be instructive. Major success is the product of minor failures, but only if the experiments meet specific criteria. They should address worthy questions with uncertain answers. They should be meticulously planned and useful regardless of the results. And they should be modest. That's the most important thing about them. The rewards are incremental because the risks are not existential. Amy Edmondson, a Harvard Business School professor and author of the forthcoming book ""Right Kind of Wrong: The Science of Failing Well,"" says the optimal bet size is hard to define but easy to describe. ""As small as possible,"" she said. ""Just big enough to be informative."" Then she put it another way: ""You don't bet the company."" Meta didn't exactly follow that advice. Last year, Mr. Zuckerberg declared that he wanted Facebook to be a metaverse company. Last week, after Meta reported another grim quarter for earnings, the CEO reiterated that he still felt that way. He understood that ""people might disagree with this investment."" He just happened to think they were wrong. ""I think people are going to look back on decades from now and talk about the importance of the work that was done here,"" he said. They have a lot more work to do. My colleagues at The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Meta's flagship metaverse had fewer than 200,000 monthly active users . There are more people who come to see the New York Mets. But it doesn't really matter that Mr. Zuckerberg's view is as lonely as the metaverse. His control of Meta's voting shares gives him an unusual form of power. ""That gives us even more responsibility to push for it and do things that other people might not be able to do,"" he recently told the tech site Protocol , adding: ""I want to live in a world where big companies use their resources to take big shots."" (A spokeswoman for Meta declined to comment but pointed to Mr. Zuckerberg's previous remarks.) Others in his shoes might feel pressure to cut their losses. But it's a good thing legs are coming to the metaverse because Mr. Zuckerberg is digging in his heels. I haven't spent much time in the metaverse—which, as it turns out, makes me like most people at Meta—and I have no plans to vacation there anytime soon. Neither does Dr. Sitkin. The metaverse has more appeal to him as a concept than a place to visit because it represents a "" stretch goal ,"" as he calls it, or a seemingly impossible task that requires some kind of external circumstance or creative breakthrough to achieve. But what really interests Dr. Sitkin is that companies avoid risk when they're doing well and inhale risk when they can least afford mistakes. This is the paradox of stretch goals. ""Those who should pursue them don't,"" he said, ""and those who shouldn't pursue them do."" Meta is an exception to that rule. It should pursue stretch goals. It did. The problem was that it stretched too far and its goal was too vague. ""You definitely want to have a parachute if you're going to jump off a high cliff,"" said Dr. Sitkin. ""And you want to know if that cliff has a staircase going down—so you can do it one step at a time."" It's entirely possible that Mr. Zuckerberg is right about the metaverse and the company's stock price will be a bargain in the long run. A website he built from a college dorm room becoming one of the world's most valuable companies also sounded crazy, and positioning Facebook for mobile at precisely the right time showed that he's been able to peek around corners of social media that few other people can see. But his latest vision requires squinting. Mr. Zuckerberg himself warned that it would take patience, trust and more than a few quarters of lousy financial results to figure out whether the metaverse bet pays off. ""This is not an investment that is going to be profitable for us anytime in the near future,"" he said one year ago. That prediction turned out to be accurate. The operating losses of its metaverse division amounted to $3.7 billion last quarter alone, and Meta's chief financial officer said that he anticipates ""operating losses in 2023 will grow significantly."" The market reacted appropriately to this comment: It freaked. Meta is now trading at its lowest price since 2016, when TikTok was a sound that clocks made, and the company has shed $23,000 a second in market cap from last year's peak. The financial incentives for intelligent failure get stronger the faster a company grows. The price of the all-or-nothing bet on nascent technology that Mr. Zuckerberg made from his dorm room was low in dollar terms. Now it's humongous. But a surprising thing about companies that have been in Meta's position is how many of them made their money back. In fact, nearly two dozen S&P 500 companies have recovered from being down 70% in one year since 2020 alone, according to Dow Jones Market Data research. Most of those losses were the result of broader forces beyond the control of those companies. The pandemic crushed department stores, but Macy's and The Gap are back above their prepandemic stock prices. Energy stocks were pounded when U.S. oil futures briefly ducked below zero , but Halliburton and Occidental Petroleumrecovered from the lows and climbed back to previous highs. Meta has plenty of headwinds in the real world, too. The economy is gloomy and interest rates are rising. A bitter dispute with Apple bruised Facebook's advertising business as competition with TikTok cut into Instagram's popularity. But what makes Meta different from the survivors of stock tumbles is what caused them to begin with. Theirs were external shocks. This one was self-inflicted. It's appropriately meta that the most compelling explanation for an $800 billion free fall is in the name of the company. That may be a failure not intelligent enough to be a success.

Meta_Facebook,"*Facebook Tried to Stir Up Political Division to Forestall Tougher Rules on Social Media, Sources Say",29 December 2021,Dow Jones Institutional News,"2,810 words",-0.1758,0.047,0.04,0.914,"English , Inc. 29 Dec 2021 *Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg Drove Response to Whistleblower Disclosures, Sources Say 29 Dec 2021 *Several Members of Meta's Safety Advisory Board Caught Off Guard by WSJ Reporting on Disclosures, Sources Say 29 Dec 2021 Facebook's Pushback: Stem the Leaks, Spin the Politics, Don't Say Sorry By Keach Hagey, Georgia Wells, Emily Glazer, Deepa Seetharaman and Jeff Horwitz The day after former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen went public in October, the company's team in Washington started working the phones. To lawmakers and advocacy groups on the right, according to people familiar with the conversations, their message was that Ms. Haugen was trying to help Democrats. Within hours, several conservative news outlets published stories alleging Ms. Haugen was a Democratic activist. Later, Facebook lobbyists warned Democratic staffers that Republicans were focused on the company's decision to ban expressions of support for Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who killed two people during unrest in Kenosha, Wis., and who was later acquitted of homicide and other charges. The company's goal, according to Republicans and Democrats familiar with the company's outreach, was to muddy the waters, divide lawmakers along partisan lines and forestall a cross-party alliance that was emerging to enact tougher rules on social-media companies in general and Facebook in particular. Ms. Haugen's revelations, and the thousands of internal documents she took with her when she quit Facebook earlier this year, showed the company's influence on political discourse, teen mental health and other matters. The resulting backlash was emerging as the company's biggest crisis in years. Pushing politics to the forefront was one part of Facebook's response, in keeping with a sharp-elbowed approach driven by Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, according to people familiar with the matter. The company conducted reputational reviews of new products. To deter further leaks, internal access settings for research discussions on topics, including mental health and radicalization, were restricted to those directly involved in the work, according to employees and others familiar with the restrictions. Company researchers said they have been asked to submit work on sensitive topics for review by company lawyers, who have sometimes asked for examples of problems to be excised from internal posts. Mr. Zuckerberg later changed the company's name to Meta Platforms Inc., to emphasize what he called a new focus on building the metaverse, an immersive digital world he has described as the next phase of the internet. He has been conducting meetings in virtual reality, with digital avatars standing in for the executives, according to people familiar with the meetings. He has encouraged other employees to do the same. The implication is that Facebook should look toward the future and not get bogged down in the messy past. Former executives said Mr. Zuckerberg has told employees not to apologize. In contrast to previous controversies, in which the CEO publicly claimed ownership of the company's mistakes and typically addressed them head-on, Mr. Zuckerberg has spoken little publicly about Ms. Haugen's disclosures and sent deputies to testify before Congress. ""When our work is being mischaracterized, we're not going to apologize,"" said Facebook spokesman Andy Stone. ""We're going to defend our record."" Facebook has acknowledged changes to its research operations but pledged to continue the work to understand the impact of its platforms. The company has also said that it invests billions of dollars to protect the safety of its users. Starting in September, The Wall Street Journal published a series of articles, called The Facebook Files, which identified harm caused by the social-media giant's platforms, as identified by its own researchers, and its challenges in addressing them. Based in part on Ms. Haugen's documents, the articles detailed such matters as how Facebook's algorithm fosters discord and how its researchers concluded that its platforms, especially Instagram, could negatively affect teen mental health. Ms. Haugen subsequently made the documents available to other media outlets, which published their own articles. Since then, there have been four U.S. congressional hearings related to issues raised in the articles; a bipartisan coalition of state attorneys general launched an investigation into Instagram's effects on children; and more than a half-dozen prominent Meta executives and other senior employees have departed or announced their departures. ""The documents speak for themselves,"" said Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, the leading Republican on the Senate antitrust subcommittee and a member of the consumer protection subcommittee. He said he is pursuing legislation that would promote more market competition in social media and add more protections for children online. Facebook has responded to criticism by citing billions of dollars of investments it has made in online safety, as well as partnerships with outside entities and experts. During a Sept. 30 hearing, Antigone Davis, Meta's global head of safety, pointed to the company's work with its safety advisory board, created more than a decade ago, which includes internet-safety experts from around the world. Facebook has previously said it conducted its own research to identify issues and devise ways to address them. Advisory board Several members of that advisory board, whose organizations are paid $25,000 a year by Meta, were caught off guard by the Journal's reporting, according to people close to it. The company hadn't shared its research into Instagram's effects on teen girls, nor had it disclosed the relatively small amount of resources committed to protect users in developing countries, those people said. Some advisory-board members proposed quitting, according to people familiar with the discussions. Some board members ultimately drafted a letter shared with Ms. Davis and other Facebook employees on Oct. 11, calling the disclosures ""a pivotal moment for Facebook."" The draft letter recommended that Facebook overhaul its business model; appoint an executive focused on safety to report to the CEO; make more internal data available to independent researchers; and clearly explain what kind of regulation they could stomach. Members of the board spoke with Facebook employees about revising the letter before sending it to Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and other Facebook leaders. In the end, no letter was sent, and no one resigned from the advisory board. Facebook's independent oversight board, which provides guidance about the company's policy-enforcement systems, also expressed its frustrations with the company, stating on its website that Meta had been ""not fully forthcoming"" in disclosing information about its troubled enforcement program for VIP users, known as XCheck. In response, the company committed to providing the board with what the board called ""wider context"" going forward. Mr. Zuckerberg pushed subordinates to respond more forcefully to the bad publicity, according to people familiar with the discussions. Nick Clegg, the company's vice president of global affairs and a former deputy prime minister of the U.K., was among those advising Mr. Zuckerberg to take a more restrained approach, according to two people familiar with the discussions. The company ultimately issued a written statement under Mr. Clegg's name in which it said the Journal's articles included ""deliberate mischaracterizations"" and cherry-picked documents, but said it was legitimate for Facebook to be scrutinized over how it dealt with serious and complex issues. Among the board of directors, longtime members Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen were the voices encouraging Mr. Zuckerberg to push back against the criticism, according to people familiar with the discussions. In a virtual meeting in late November, some of Meta's largest institutional investors asked Facebook to address some of the issues around user safety, according to people familiar with the call. Some investors found Mr. Zuckerberg, who also is chairman, defensive on the call, these people said. They left dissatisfied with Facebook's overall response, because the company reiterated previous talking points and didn't share any big new changes, according to a written briefing about the meeting described to the Journal. Meta shares are down about 9% since the publication of the first of the Journal's Facebook Files articles. In early December, Facebook's board convened for its annual retreat at Mr. Zuckerberg's 1,300-acre beachfront estate in Kauai, Hawaii. Board members discussed matters including Ms. Haugen and the release of internal documents, regulatory issues and how to chart a path forward for the company on the metaverse, people familiar with the meetings said. While they were losing some top executives and the recent past had been challenging, officials were broadly supportive of Mr. Zuckerberg's push toward the next phase of the virtual world, people familiar with the discussions said. Separately, some Meta officials have discussed hiring a high-ranking outsider who could take some of the pressure off Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg and add a fresh perspective to the senior ranks, one person familiar with the discussion said. The Facebook spokesman said no such conversation took place at the board meeting or other official event. Mr. Zuckerberg isn't in favor of major changes to Meta's product strategy. Before the head of Instagram testified at a congressional hearing in December about the platform's impact on teens, Meta executives discussed the possibility of ending development on its version of Instagram for children, one of the people familiar with those discussions said. Mr. Zuckerberg said that wasn't an option, the person said. The company has said the project is paused indefinitely. The company considered suing Ms. Haugen but decided the public perception would be that it was trying to silence a whistleblower, said people familiar with the matter. Political spin 29 Dec 2021 Facebook's Pushback: Stem the Leaks, Spin the -2- Instead, after Ms. Haugen was identified as the source of the documents in an article in the Journal and an appearance on ""60 Minutes,"" prompting some conservative media figures to express skepticism about her motivations, the company and its representatives spread word among lawmakers' offices, advocacy groups and others that she had partisan motives, according to the people familiar with those conversations. Similar allegations soon appeared in right-leaning publications including the Daily Wire, the Washington Free Beacon and the Spectator. The articles variously called Ms. Haugen ""the frontwoman of a PR campaign pushed by the Democratic party,"" a ""leftist activist"" and someone who is ""part of a broader Democratic initiative."" Some of the calls were made by Josh Althouse, a public-policy manager in Facebook's Washington office, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Althouse, a former aide to onetime House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), helps manage Facebook's relationships with prominent conservatives. Some of the articles noted that Ms. Haugen was working with a public-relations firm run by former Obama aides, and had contributed just under $2,000 to Democratic politicians over the past five years. Separately, Facebook representatives alleged in conversations with reporters that she was a proxy for Pierre Omidyar, the billionaire eBay founder who has funded advocacy groups hostile to large technology firms, according to people familiar with the discussions. The Omidyar Network, the philanthropic investment firm co-founded by Mr. Omidyar and his wife, didn't respond to a request for comment. Ms. Haugen has denied any partisan motivations, and said she has accepted limited assistance but no money from Omidyar-affiliated nonprofits. She said she believes the issues identified in the documents stretch across party lines and that in recent months, she has met with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers to discuss the company and her views on how it should be regulated. Some lawmakers believe regulatory action on social media is one of the few areas where bipartisanship is currently possible. ""Their biggest fear has been conservatives and liberals coming together to break up their so-called family of apps, and it could very well be coming very soon,"" said David Bozell, president of ForAmerica, a conservative group that creates political content on social media. ""It's not every day that [Republican] Mike Lee, [Democrat] Amy Klobuchar and [Republican] Ken Buck get together and break bread on these things -- on anything."" Mr. Bozell said he was contacted by the company after Ms. Haugen went public, but they didn't discuss her. He declined to discuss what was said. The potential sticking point, according to lawmakers and aides from both parties, will likely be around political speech and what role social-media companies should play in policing it. Another: The abundance of legislative efforts in the works. One Senate aide estimated there are at least 30 bills that have been proposed that would update the regulatory framework for Meta and social media more broadly. Some former Meta employees have gone public to validate the research findings in the documents, although some of them have criticized the manner in which they became public. Among them was Samidh Chakrabarti, who founded Facebook's civic-integrity team, which is devoted to promoting democracy and protecting elections, and ran it for six years before resigning from the company earlier this year. The former executive, who says he declines to speak with reporters on those issues, has been active on Twitter trying to explain technically complex issues and at times rebut the company's responses to articles based on the disclosures. ""I was there for over 6 years, had numerous direct reports, and led many decision meetings with C-level execs, and I find the perspectives shared on the need for algorithmic regulation, research transparency, and independent oversight to be entirely valid for debate,"" he tweeted in September. Legislative fallout In late October, more than a dozen data scientists, engineers and researchers who worked at Facebook and other platforms launched the Integrity Institute, a nonprofit aiming to discuss solutions to platform-design problems at social-media companies. A bipartisan group of senators consulted the institute while drafting legislation that would compel Facebook and other platforms to provide data access to outside researchers. In the U.K., the led legislators to propose updates to a draft bill to regulate large social-media companies by empowering a regulator to oversee how they mitigate harms stemming from their services. This month, a U.K. Parliament committee recommended the bill require companies to supply regulators with data such as the proportion of users that are children, and oblige them to find and address ""reasonably foreseeable harm"" resulting from their platforms -- changes the committee chairman said stemmed from the Journal's reporting. In the European Union, member states managed to settle their disputes over provisions of a draft social-media regulation bill after the disclosures. Next, the member state Council will negotiate with the EU's parliament with the aim of reaching a compromise text and passing it into law in the spring. In India, Facebook's largest market by users, the Parliament's Standing Committee on Information Technology last month summoned company representatives to a closed-door hearing to discuss safeguarding citizens' rights and preventing the ""misuse of social/online news media platforms,"" according to an official description of the meeting. Members of Parliament are seeking to initiate in coming months a joint parliamentary committee to investigate Facebook's operations in India, according to one person familiar with the matter. Stephan Loerke, chief executive of the World Federation of Advertisers, a trade group that includes many big advertisers and historically has advocated self-regulation, said his group has supported some of the regulation coming out of the U.K. and Europe that would rein in Facebook. Inside Facebook, surveys in the weeks following the first articles showed the percentage of employees who reported ""optimism"" fell by 10 percentage points, while other categories showed a conflicted workforce, according to results reviewed by the Journal. Just under half of employees reported having confidence in leadership, while roughly the same amount said they believed Facebook contributed to social good. About three-quarters reported overall job satisfaction. Within a couple of months, questions about compensation and benefits surpassed societal issues in the rankings of questions submitted to executives before the company's weekly question-and-answer session. On Nov. 18, the most popular question was: ""Will our yearly salary raises reflect the increased levels of inflation we've been seeing?"" --Sam Schechner and Newley Purnell contributed to this article.--Design by Andrew Levinson.

Meta_Facebook,Business/Financial Desk; SECTB,22 June 2022,The New York Times,"1,264 words",0.9559,0.07,0.053,0.877,"1 English .  The Justice Department had accused Meta's housing advertising system of discriminating against Facebook users based on their race, gender, religion and other characteristics. SAN FRANCISCO -- Meta on Tuesday agreed to alter its ad technology and pay a penalty of $115,054, in a settlement with the Justice Department over claims that the company's ad systems had discriminated against Facebook users by restricting who was able to see housing ads on the platform based on their race, gender and ZIP code. Under the agreement, Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, said it would change its technology and use a new computer-assisted method that aims to regularly check whether those who are targeted and eligible to receive housing ads are, in fact, seeing those ads. The new method, which is referred to as a ''variance reduction system,'' relies on machine learning to ensure that advertisers are delivering ads related to housing to specific protected classes of people. ''Meta will -- for the first time -- change its ad delivery system to address algorithmic discrimination,'' Damian Williams, a U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement. ''But if Meta fails to demonstrate that it has sufficiently changed its delivery system to guard against algorithmic bias, this office will proceed with the litigation.'' Facebook, which became a business colossus by collecting its users' data and letting advertisers target ads based on the characteristics of an audience, has faced complaints for years that some of those practices are biased and discriminatory. The company's ad systems have allowed marketers to choose who saw their ads by using thousands of different characteristics, which have also let those advertisers exclude people who fall under a number of protected categories, such as race, gender and age. The Justice Department filed both its suit and the settlement against Meta on Tuesday. In its suit, the agency said it had concluded that ''Facebook could achieve its interests in maximizing its revenue and providing relevant ads to users through less discriminatory means.'' While the settlement pertains specifically to housing ads, Meta said it also planned to apply its new system to check the targeting of ads related to employment and credit. The company has previously faced blowback for allowing bias against women in job ads and excluding certain groups of people from seeing credit card ads. The issue of biased ad targeting has been especially debated in housing ads. In 2016, Facebook's potential for ad discrimination was revealed in an investigation by ProPublica, which showed that the company's technology made it simple for marketers to exclude specific ethnic groups for advertising purposes. In 2018, Ben Carson, who was the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, announced a formal complaint against Facebook, accusing the company of having ad systems that ''unlawfully discriminated'' based on categories such as race, religion and disability. In 2019, HUD sued Facebook for engaging in housing discrimination and violating the Fair Housing Act. The agency said Facebook's systems did not deliver ads to ''a diverse audience,'' even if an advertiser wanted the ad to be seen broadly. ''Facebook is discriminating against people based upon who they are and where they live,'' Mr. Carson said at the time. ''Using a computer to limit a person's housing choices can be just as discriminatory as slamming a door in someone's face.'' The Justice Department's lawsuit and settlement is based partly on HUD's 2019 investigation and discrimination charge against Facebook. In its own tests related to the issue, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York found that Meta's ad systems directed housing ads away from certain categories of people, even when advertisers were not aiming to do so. The ads were steered ''disproportionately to white users and away from Black users, and vice versa,'' according to the Justice Department's complaint. Many housing ads in neighborhoods where most of the people were white were also directed primarily to white users, while housing ads in areas that were largely Black were shown mainly to Black users, the complaint added. As a result, the complaint said, Facebook's algorithms ''actually and predictably reinforce or perpetuate segregated housing patterns because of race.'' In recent years, civil rights groups have also been pushing back against the vast and complicated advertising systems that underpin some of the largest internet platforms. The groups have argued that those systems have inherent biases built into them, and that tech companies like Meta, Google and others should do more to bat back those biases. The area of study, known as ''algorithmic fairness,'' has been a significant topic of interest among computer scientists in the field of artificial intelligence. Leading researchers, including former Google scientists like Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell, have sounded the alarm bell on such biases for years. In the years since, Facebook has clamped down on the types of categories that marketers could choose from when purchasing housing ads, cutting the number down to hundreds and eliminating options to target based on race, age and ZIP code. Chancela Al-Mansour, executive director of the Housing Rights Center in Los Angeles, said it was ''essential'' that ''fair housing laws be aggressively enforced.'' ''Housing ads had become tools for unlawful behavior, including segregation and discrimination in housing, employment and credit,'' she said. ''Most users had no idea they were either being targeted for or denied housing ads based on their race and other characteristics.'' Meta's new ad technology, which is still in development, will occasionally check on who is being served ads for housing, employment and credit, and make sure those audiences match up with the people marketers want to target. If the ads being served begin to skew heavily toward white men in their 20s, for example, the new system will theoretically recognize this and shift the ads to be served more equitably among broader and more varied audiences. ''We're going to be occasionally taking a snapshot of marketers' audiences, seeing who they target, and removing as much variance as we can from that audience,'' Roy L. Austin, Meta's vice president of civil rights and a deputy general counsel, said in an interview. He called it ''a significant technological advancement for how machine learning is used to deliver personalized ads.'' Meta said it would work with HUD over the coming months to incorporate the technology into Meta's ad targeting systems, and agreed to a third-party audit of the new system's effectiveness. The company also said it would no longer use a feature called ''special ad audiences,'' a tool it had developed to help advertisers expand the groups of people their ads would reach. The Justice Department said the tool also engaged in discriminatory practices. Meta said the tool was an early effort to fight against biases, and that its new methods would be more effective. The $115,054 penalty that Meta agreed to pay in the settlement is the maximum available under the Fair Housing Act, the Justice Department said. ''The public should know the latest abuse by Facebook was worth the same amount of money Meta makes in about 20 seconds,'' said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, an association for premium publishers. As part of the settlement, Meta did not admit to any wrongdoing. is paying a penalty in its settlement with the Justice Department. (PHOTOGRAPH BY JIM WILSON/THE NEW YORK TIMES) (B4)"
Meta_Facebook,"*Sheryl Sandberg's Use of Facebook Resources for Personal Projects Is Under Scrutiny, Sources Say -- WSJ",10 June 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,370 words",0.5645,0.057,0.042,0.901,"English , Inc. 10 Jun 2022 *Meta Platforms' Lawyers Examining COO's Behavior Going Back Several Years, Sources Say -- WSJ 10 Jun 2022 *Meta Platforms Already Makes Extensive Disclosures About Top Executives' Use of Corporate Resources for Certain Personal Matters -- WSJ 10 Jun 2022 Meta Scrutinizing Sheryl Sandberg's Use of Facebook Resources Over Several Years -- WSJ By Deepa Seetharaman and Emily Glazer The lawyers investigating Facebook operating chief Sheryl Sandberg's use of corporate resources are examining behavior going back several years, said people familiar with the matter, focusing on the extent to which staffers worked on her personal projects. A number of employees have been interviewed as part of the investigation by Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., the people said, adding that the review has been under way since at least last fall. It includes an examination of the work Facebook employees did to support her foundation, Lean In, which advocates for women in the workplace, as well as the writing and promotion of her second book ""Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy,"" which focused on her grieving process following the sudden death of her husband, SurveyMonkey CEO Dave Goldberg, in 2015, the people said. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that the investigation included a review of Ms. Sandberg's use of corporate resources to help plan her coming wedding. That is a small piece of the investigation, according to the people familiar with the matter, who said it involves a broader review of Ms. Sandberg's personal use of Facebook's resources over many years. Ms. Sandberg, 52 years old, announced last week she was resigning from her day-to-day role after 14 years, though she said she would continue to serve on the board of directors. Ms. Sandberg has been the longtime lieutenant to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, and in that role -- and as the author of the leadership book ""Lean In"" -- became one of the most prominent women in business. Ms. Sandberg said she was looking forward to spending more time on her foundation and women's issues. Ms. Sandberg has told friends and co-workers that she decided to step down because she was burned-out and weary of continuing her role as a ""punching bag"" for Meta's critics. She also sees Mr. Zuckerberg's pivot to the so-called metaverse as a multiyear project that she wasn't eager to take on, not least because it doesn't directly entail the use of her core strengths in building advertising businesses. People close to Ms. Sandberg say that while the review has irked her in recent months, it played no role in her decision to leave the company later this year. ""Sheryl did not inappropriately use company resources in connection with the planning of her wedding,"" a spokeswoman for Ms. Sandberg said last week. A Meta spokeswoman declined to comment for this article. It couldn't be determined what prompted the investigation into her activities that began in the fall. Some people close to the company said these types of concerns involving Ms. Sandberg had circulated for some time. They said that as Ms. Sandberg's power within the company appeared to erode in recent years, it became less daunting for internal critics to raise concerns about her management. That Ms. Sandberg, along with Mr. Zuckerberg, use corporate resources for some personal matters is no secret. The company already makes extensive disclosures about her and Mr. Zuckerberg's use of corporate resources for certain personal matters. Ms. Sandberg also cited a number of Facebook employees in the acknowledgments section of Option B. Ms. Sandberg could be asked to repay the company for employee time spent on her personal work, some of the people said. Some within Meta close to the investigation worry about potential Securities and Exchange Commission violations if Ms. Sandberg used professional resources for personal matters without adequate disclosures, although it isn't yet clear what such violations might be, people familiar with the matter said. David Larcker, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who focuses on corporate governance, said companies differ in what types of perks they approve for top executives but private jet use and security are often included. Some companies benchmark such benefits with their peers so they can stay competitive with executive compensation practices, whether corporate jet use, financial adviser assistance, country club memberships or otherwise. But using corporate employees who aren't assistants for personal matters is more rare and likely requires board approval, he added. Some Meta board members have been frustrated with Ms. Sandberg's handling of a situation in which she helped press a U.K. tabloid to shelve an article about her former boyfriend, Activision Blizzard Inc. Chief Executive Bobby Kotick, and a 2014 temporary restraining order against him. The matter also became a part of the broader investigation, according to people familiar with the matter. The Journal previously reported the Kotick issue and a spokeswoman for Meta said at the time: ""Sheryl Sandberg never threatened the MailOnline's business relationship with Facebook in order to influence an editorial decision."" Mr. Kotick has said it was his understanding that the Daily Mail didn't run the story because it was untrue. The probe into Ms. Sandberg's activities follows a renewed effort within Facebook to boost the company's regulatory compliance, following a $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in 2019. Facebook hired its first chief compliance officer last year in order to beef up such checks and balances. Some parts of the investigation into Ms. Sandberg's actions occurred after more stringent compliance practices were put in place at Meta, some of the people said. Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives have sometimes used company resources, including private planes and staff time, to manage their personal affairs as well, according to securities filings, public documents and people familiar with the matter. The reputation and safety of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg have been long seen as inextricably linked to the company's success. Facebook has hired professional pollsters to analyze their personal reputations, according to people familiar with the matter, because they were seen as connected to the image of the company overall. People close to the executives say many of their activities -- and of business executives broadly -- aren't strictly professional or personal but rather a bit of both and enrich them as leaders generally and help the company, including for recruiting. Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg both use private planes for personal travel as part of their overall security program, according to Facebook's latest proxy. Both executives also receive personal security at their residences as well as during personal travel, paid for by the company. In 2021, Facebook paid nearly $9 million for Ms. Sandberg's security at her homes and during personal travel and $2.3 million for costs related to her personal use of private planes, according to the company's most recent proxy. Facebook spent $15.2 million on Mr. Zuckerberg's security and $1.6 million in private plane costs. Facebook staff assisted Ms. Sandberg during both of her book tours and in the acknowledgments of Option B, she thanked many employees for their assistance in putting the book together. It was also not uncommon for Facebook staffers to help Ms. Sandberg with work involving her foundation and sometimes assist with tasks for her family, according to people close to the matter. Some people close to Ms. Sandberg said it was often more efficient to work that way. Facebook employees also worked on Mr. Zuckerberg's projects, including his 2017 tour of 30 American states, according to public records. One stop in Glacier National Park in Montana, Mr. Zuckerberg was joined by at least three full-time Facebook employees, according to public records. At the time, he called it a ""personal challenge."" and Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires June 10, 2022 (17:40 GMT)"
Meta_Facebook,The Facebook Files,29 December 2021,The Wall Street Journal Online,"2,794 words",0.8956,0.059,0.039,0.902,"The day after former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen went public in October, the company's team in Washington started working the phones. To lawmakers and advocacy groups on the right, according to people familiar with the conversations, their message was that Ms. Haugen was trying to help Democrats. Within hours, several conservative news outlets published stories alleging Ms. Haugen was a Democratic activist. Later, Facebook lobbyists warned Democratic staffers that Republicans were focused on the company's decision to ban expressions of support for Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who killed two people during unrest in Kenosha, Wis., and who was later acquitted of homicide and other charges. The company's goal, according to Republicans and Democrats familiar with the company's outreach, was to muddy the waters, divide lawmakers along partisan lines and forestall a cross-party alliance that was emerging to enact tougher rules on social-media companies in general and Facebook in particular. Ms. Haugen's revelations, and the thousands of internal documents she took with her when she quit Facebook earlier this year, showed the company's influence on political discourse , teen mental health and other matters. The resulting backlash was emerging as the company's biggest crisis in years. Pushing politics to the forefront was one part of Facebook 's response, in keeping with a sharp-elbowed approach driven by Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg , according to people familiar with the matter. The company conducted reputational reviews of new products . To deter further leaks, internal access settings for research discussions on topics, including mental health and radicalization, were restricted to those directly involved in the work , according to employees and others familiar with the restrictions. Company researchers said they have been asked to submit work on sensitive topics for review by company lawyers, who have sometimes asked for examples of problems to be excised from internal posts. Mr. Zuckerberg later changed the company's name to Meta Platforms Inc ., to emphasize what he called a new focus on building the metaverse, an immersive digital world he has described as the next phase of the internet. He has been conducting meetings in virtual reality, with digital avatars standing in for the executives, according to people familiar with the meetings. He has encouraged other employees to do the same. The implication is that Facebook should look toward the future and not get bogged down in the messy past. Download: The Facebook Files Ebook WSJ subscribers are invited to download an exclusive collection of coverage from WSJ reporters on The Facebook Files. Former executives said Mr. Zuckerberg has told employees not to apologize. In contrast to previous controversies, in which the CEO publicly claimed ownership of the company's mistakes and typically addressed them head-on, Mr. Zuckerberg has spoken little publicly about Ms. Haugen's disclosures and sent deputies to testify before Congress. ""When our work is being mischaracterized, we're not going to apologize,"" said Facebook spokesman Andy Stone . ""We're going to defend our record."" Facebook has acknowledged changes to its research operations but pledged to continue the work to understand the impact of its platforms. The company has also said that it invests billions of dollars to protect the safety of its users. Starting in September, The Wall Street Journal published a series of articles , called The Facebook Files, which identified harm caused by the social-media giant's platforms, as identified by its own researchers, and its challenges in addressing them. Based in part on Ms. Haugen's documents, the articles detailed such matters as how Facebook 's algorithm fosters discord and how its researchers concluded that its platforms, especially Instagram , could negatively affect teen mental health. Ms. Haugen subsequently made the documents available to other media outlets, which published their own articles. Since then, there have been four U.S. congressional hearings related to issues raised in the articles; a bipartisan coalition of state attorneys general launched an investigation into Instagram 's effects on children; and more than a half-dozen prominent Meta executives and other senior employees have departed or announced their departures. ""The documents speak for themselves,"" said Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, the leading Republican on the Senate antitrust subcommittee and a member of the consumer protection subcommittee. He said he is pursuing legislation that would promote more market competition in social media and add more protections for children online. Facebook has responded to criticism by citing billions of dollars of investments it has made in online safety, as well as partnerships with outside entities and experts. During a Sept. 30 hearing, Antigone Davis, Meta 's global head of safety, pointed to the company's work with its safety advisory board, created more than a decade ago, which includes internet-safety experts from around the world. Facebook has previously said it conducted its own research to identify issues and devise ways to address them. Advisory board Several members of that advisory board, whose organizations are paid $25,000 a year by Meta , were caught off guard by the Journal's reporting, according to people close to it. The company hadn't shared its research into Instagram 's effects on teen girls, nor had it disclosed the relatively small amount of resources committed to protect users in developing countries, those people said. Some advisory-board members proposed quitting, according to people familiar with the discussions. Some board members ultimately drafted a letter shared with Ms. Davis and other Facebook employees on Oct. 11, calling the disclosures ""a pivotal moment for Facebook ."" The draft letter recommended that Facebook overhaul its business model; appoint an executive focused on safety to report to the CEO; make more internal data available to independent researchers; and clearly explain what kind of regulation they could stomach. Members of the board spoke with Facebook employees about revising the letter before sending it to Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and other Facebook leaders. In the end, no letter was sent, and no one resigned from the advisory board. Facebook 's independent oversight board, which provides guidance about the company's policy-enforcement systems, also expressed its frustrations with the company, stating on its website that Meta had been ""not fully forthcoming"" in disclosing information about its troubled enforcement program for VIP users , known as XCheck. In response, the company committed to providing the board with what the board called ""wider context"" going forward. Mr. Zuckerberg pushed subordinates to respond more forcefully to the bad publicity, according to people familiar with the discussions. Nick Clegg , the company's vice president of global affairs and a former deputy prime minister of the U.K., was among those advising Mr. Zuckerberg to take a more restrained approach, according to two people familiar with the discussions. The company ultimately issued a written statement under Mr. Clegg's name in which it said the Journal's articles included ""deliberate mischaracterizations"" and cherry-picked documents, but said it was legitimate for Facebook to be scrutinized over how it dealt with serious and complex issues. Among the board of directors, longtime members Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen were the voices encouraging Mr. Zuckerberg to push back against the criticism, according to people familiar with the discussions. In a virtual meeting in late November, some of Meta 's largest institutional investors asked Facebook to address some of the issues around user safety, according to people familiar with the call. Some investors found Mr. Zuckerberg, who also is chairman, defensive on the call, these people said. They left dissatisfied with Facebook 's overall response, because the company reiterated previous talking points and didn't share any big new changes, according to a written briefing about the meeting described to the Journal. Meta shares are down about 9% since the publication of the first of the Journal's Facebook Files articles. In early December, Facebook 's board convened for its annual retreat at Mr. Zuckerberg's 1,300-acre beachfront estate in Kauai, Hawaii. Board members discussed matters including Ms. Haugen and the release of internal documents, regulatory issues and how to chart a path forward for the company on the metaverse, people familiar with the meetings said. While they were losing some top executives and the recent past had been challenging, officials were broadly supportive of Mr. Zuckerberg's push toward the next phase of the virtual world, people familiar with the discussions said. Separately, some Meta officials have discussed hiring a high-ranking outsider who could take some of the pressure off Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg and add a fresh perspective to the senior ranks, one person familiar with the discussion said. The Facebook spokesman said no such conversation took place at the board meeting or other official event. Mr. Zuckerberg isn't in favor of major changes to Meta 's product strategy. Before the head of Instagram testified at a congressional hearing in December about the platform's impact on teens, Meta executives discussed the possibility of ending development on its version of Instagram for children, one of the people familiar with those discussions said. Mr. Zuckerberg said that wasn't an option, the person said. The company has said the project is paused indefinitely . The company considered suing Ms. Haugen but decided the public perception would be that it was trying to silence a whistleblower, said people familiar with the matter. Political spin Instead, after Ms. Haugen was identified as the source of the documents in an article in the Journal and an appearance on ""60 Minutes,"" prompting some conservative media figures to express skepticism about her motivations, the company and its representatives spread word among lawmakers' offices, advocacy groups and others that she had partisan motives, according to the people familiar with those conversations. Similar allegations soon appeared in right-leaning publications including the Daily Wire , the Washington Free Beacon and the Spectator . The articles variously called Ms. Haugen ""the frontwoman of a PR campaign pushed by the Democratic party,"" a ""leftist activist"" and someone who is ""part of a broader Democratic initiative."" Some of the calls were made by Josh Althouse, a public-policy manager in Facebook 's Washington office, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Althouse, a former aide to onetime House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), helps manage Facebook 's relationships with prominent conservatives. Some of the articles noted that Ms. Haugen was working with a public-relations firm run by former Obama aides, and had contributed just under $2,000 to Democratic politicians over the past five years. Separately, Facebook representatives alleged in conversations with reporters that she was a proxy for Pierre Omidyar , the billionaire eBay founder who has funded advocacy groups hostile to large technology firms, according to people familiar with the discussions. The Omidyar Network , the philanthropic investment firm co-founded by Mr. Omidyar and his wife, didn't respond to a request for comment. Ms. Haugen has denied any partisan motivations, and said she has accepted limited assistance but no money from Omidyar-affiliated nonprofits. She said she believes the issues identified in the documents stretch across party lines and that in recent months, she has met with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers to discuss the company and her views on how it should be regulated. Some lawmakers believe regulatory action on social media is one of the few areas where bipartisanship is currently possible. ""Their biggest fear has been conservatives and liberals coming together to break up their so-called family of apps, and it could very well be coming very soon,"" said David Bozell, president of ForAmerica, a conservative group that creates political content on social media. ""It's not every day that [Republican] Mike Lee , [Democrat] Amy Klobuchar and [Republican] Ken Buck get together and break bread on these things—on anything."" Mr. Bozell said he was contacted by the company after Ms. Haugen went public, but they didn't discuss her. He declined to discuss what was said. The potential sticking point, according to lawmakers and aides from both parties, will likely be around political speech and what role social-media companies should play in policing it. Another: The abundance of legislative efforts in the works. One Senate aide estimated there are at least 30 bills that have been proposed that would update the regulatory framework for Meta and social media more broadly. Some former Meta employees have gone public to validate the research findings in the documents, although some of them have criticized the manner in which they became public. Among them was Samidh Chakrabarti, who founded Facebook 's civic-integrity team, which is devoted to promoting democracy and protecting elections, and ran it for six years before resigning from the company earlier this year. The former executive, who says he declines to speak with reporters on those issues, has been active on Twitter trying to explain technically complex issues and at times rebut the company's responses to articles based on the disclosures. ""I was there for over 6 years, had numerous direct reports, and led many decision meetings with C-level execs, and I find the perspectives shared on the need for algorithmic regulation, research transparency, and independent oversight to be entirely valid for debate,"" he tweeted in September. Legislative fallout In late October, more than a dozen data scientists, engineers and researchers who worked at Facebook and other platforms launched the Integrity Institute, a nonprofit aiming to discuss solutions to platform-design problems at social-media companies. A bipartisan group of senators consulted the institute while drafting legislation that would compel Facebook and other platforms to provide data access to outside researchers. In the U.K., the led legislators to propose updates to a draft bill to regulate large social-media companies by empowering a regulator to oversee how they mitigate harms stemming from their services. This month, a U.K. Parliament committee recommended the bill require companies to supply regulators with data such as the proportion of users that are children, and oblige them to find and address ""reasonably foreseeable harm"" resulting from their platforms—changes the committee chairman said stemmed from the Journal's reporting. In the European Union , member states managed to settle their disputes over provisions of a draft social-media regulation bill after the disclosures. Next, the member state Council will negotiate with the EU 's Parliament with the aim of reaching a compromise text and passing it into law in the spring. In India, Facebook 's largest market by users, the Parliament's Standing Committee on Information Technology last month summoned company representatives to a closed-door hearing to discuss safeguarding citizens' rights and preventing the ""misuse of social/online news media platforms,"" according to an official description of the meeting. Members of Parliament are seeking to initiate in coming months a joint parliamentary committee to investigate Facebook 's operations in India, according to one person familiar with the matter. Stephan Loerke, chief executive of the World Federation of Advertisers , a trade group that includes many big advertisers and historically has advocated self-regulation, said his group has supported some of the regulation coming out of the U.K. and Europe that would rein in Facebook . Inside Facebook , surveys in the weeks following the first articles showed the percentage of employees who reported ""optimism"" fell by 10 percentage points, while other categories showed a conflicted workforce, according to results reviewed by the Journal. Just under half of employees reported having confidence in leadership, while roughly the same amount said they believed Facebook contributed to social good. About three-quarters reported overall job satisfaction. Within a couple of months, questions about compensation and benefits surpassed societal issues in the rankings of questions submitted to executives before the company's weekly question-and-answer session. On Nov. 18, the most popular question was: ""Will our yearly salary raises reflect the increased levels of inflation we've been seeing?"" Sam Schechner and Newley Purnell contributed to this article.

Meta_Facebook,Business/Financial Desk; SECTB,10 November 2021,The New York Times,"1,020 words",0.7388,0.069,0.058,0.873,"1 English .  Ad buyers will no longer be able to use topics such as health, race or sexual orientation to target people with unwanted ads on Facebook or other Meta apps. SAN FRANCISCO -- Meta, the social media company formerly known as Facebook, said on Tuesday that it planned to eliminate advertisers' ability to target people with promotions based on their interactions with content related to health, race and ethnicity, political affiliation, religion, sexual orientation and thousands of other topics. The move, which takes effect on Jan. 19, affects advertisers on Meta's apps such as Facebook, Instagram and Messenger and the company's audience network, which places ads in third-party apps. The Silicon Valley company said it was making the changes to limit the way that its targeting tools can be abused. In the past, these features have been used to discriminate against people or to spam them with unwanted messaging. ''We've heard concerns from experts that targeting options like these could be used in ways that lead to negative experiences for people in underrepresented groups,'' said Graham Mudd, a vice president of product marketing for Meta. Meta relies on targeted advertising for the bulk of its $86 billion in annual revenue. The company has excelled at giving advertisers a place to personalize promotions, with brands often able to aim their ads at Facebook, Instagram and Messenger users who are interested in topics as specific as L.G.B.T.Q. culture or Catholicism. Such tailored ads often have a better chance of sparking a sale or prompting users to join a particular Facebook group or support an online organization than more generalized ads. But Meta has also faced a litany of complaints about advertisers abusing these targeting abilities. Before the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol, for example, advertisers used targeting tools to direct promotions for body armor, gun holsters and rifle enhancements at far-right militia groups on Facebook. In 2020, auditors concluded that Facebook had not done enough to protect people who use its service from discriminatory posts and ads. In 2019, the Department of Housing and Urban Development sued Facebook for allowing landlords and home sellers to unfairly restrict who could see ads for their properties on the platform based on characteristics like race, religion and national origin. And in 2017, ProPublica found that Facebook's algorithms had generated ad categories for users interested in topics such as ''Jew hater'' and ''how to burn jews.'' In response to the abuse, the social network has tweaked its ad-targeting tools over time. In 2018, it removed 5,000 ad-targeting classifications to keep advertisers from excluding certain users. Facebook also disabled the anti-Semitic ad categories after the ProPublica report. But Meta's latest changes may be unpopular with the millions of organizations that rely on the company's tools to expand their audiences and build their businesses. Advertising on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger that is finely tuned to people's interests is often more affordable and effective than advertising on broadcast television and other media. Those organizations include political groups and advocacy groups, many of which rely on the platform for fund-raising. Last year, political campaigns and nongovernmental organizations criticized Facebook when it temporarily removed political advertising from its sites around the presidential election; the restriction was lifted in March. Some campaigns said the move had benefited incumbents and larger organizations that didn't count on small donations through Facebook. Republicans and Democrats blasted Meta's changes on Tuesday. Reid Vineis, a vice president of Majority Strategies, a digital ad-buying firm that works with Republicans, said in an emailed statement that the social network had gone from being ''the gold standard for political advertising'' to throwing roadblocks between campaigns and voters. ''This decision is harmful to nonprofit and public affairs advertisers across the board and will result in fewer charitable donations, limited public debate and a less informed public,'' he said. Mr. Mudd said that the new policies would be unpopular with some, but that the company had decided that moving forward was the best course. ''Like many of our decisions, this was not a simple choice and required a balance of competing interests where there was advocacy in both directions,'' he said. He added that some of the ad changes had been under discussion since 2016. Augustine Fou, an independent ad fraud researcher, said advertising on Facebook and its other apps had long worked ''better than any other display ads elsewhere because Facebook has years of people volunteering information, and it's pretty accurate.'' He added that personalized advertising outside the platform often relied on guesswork that was ''so wildly inaccurate that when you try to target based on that, you're worse off than trying to spray and pray.'' Yet Meta has often struggled with how to take advantage of consumer data without abusing it. ''Of course, Facebook can deduce that you're gay, or that you're African American, but then the question becomes whether it is ethical to use those categories for targeting,'' Mr. Fou said. The new changes do not mean Meta is getting out of ad targeting. The company will still allow it for tens of thousands of other categories, which some critics said advertisers could use to achieve targeting similar to what the removed topics gave them. Meta added that it would continue to use tools such as location targeting. The company also said it would let users, who can already limit their exposure to ads about topics such as politics and alcohol, start blocking promotions related to gambling and weight loss early next year. ''We continue to believe strongly in personalized advertising, and frankly personalized experiences overall are core to who we are and what we do,'' Mr. Mudd said. said it was making changes, to take effect Jan. 19, as a way to limit abuse by its targeting tools, such as enabling bias or fueling spam.

Meta_Facebook,Meta Scrutinizing Sheryl Sandberg’s Use of Facebook Resources Over Several Years,10 June 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,296 words",0.8986,0.064,0.036,0.9,"English , Inc. The lawyers investigating Facebook operating chief Sheryl Sandberg’s use of corporate resources are examining behavior going back several years, said people familiar with the matter, focusing on the extent to which staffers worked on her personal projects. A number of employees have been interviewed as part of the investigation by Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., the people said, adding that the review has been under way since at least last fall. It includes an examination of the work Facebook employees did to support her foundation, Lean In, which advocates for women in the workplace, as well as the writing and promotion of her second book “Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy,” which focused on her grieving process following the sudden death of her husband, SurveyMonkey CEO Dave Goldberg, in 2015, the people said. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that the investigation included a review of Ms. Sandberg’s use of corporate resources to help plan her coming wedding. That is a small piece of the investigation, according to the people familiar with the matter, who said it involves a broader review of Ms. Sandberg’s personal use of Facebook’s resources over many years. Ms. Sandberg, 52 years old, announced last week she was resigning from her day-to-day role after 14 years, though she said she would continue to serve on the board of directors. Ms. Sandberg has been the longtime lieutenant to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, and in that role—and as the author of the leadership book “Lean In”—became one of the most prominent women in business. Ms. Sandberg said she was looking forward to spending more time on her foundation and women’s issues. Ms. Sandberg has told friends and co-workers that she decided to step down because she was burned-out and weary of continuing her role as a “punching bag” for Meta’s critics. She also sees Mr. Zuckerberg’s pivot to the so-called metaverse as a multiyear project that she wasn’t eager to take on, not least because it doesn’t directly entail the use of her core strengths in building advertising businesses. People close to Ms. Sandberg say that while the review has irked her in recent months, it played no role in her decision to leave the company later this year. “Sheryl did not inappropriately use company resources in connection with the planning of her wedding,” a spokeswoman for Ms. Sandberg said last week. A Meta spokeswoman declined to comment for this article. It couldn’t be determined what prompted the investigation into her activities that began in the fall. Some people close to the company said these types of concerns involving Ms. Sandberg had circulated for some time. They said that as Ms. Sandberg’s power within the company appeared to erode in recent years, it became less daunting for internal critics to raise concerns about her management. That Ms. Sandberg, along with Mr. Zuckerberg, use corporate resources for some personal matters is no secret. The company already makes extensive disclosures about her and Mr. Zuckerberg’s use of corporate resources for certain personal matters. Ms. Sandberg also cited a number of Facebook employees in the acknowledgments section of Option B. Ms. Sandberg could be asked to repay the company for employee time spent on her personal work, some of the people said. Some within Meta close to the investigation worry about potential Securities and Exchange Commission violations if Ms. Sandberg used professional resources for personal matters without adequate disclosures, although it isn’t yet clear what such violations might be, people familiar with the matter said. David Larcker, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who focuses on corporate governance, said companies differ in what types of perks they approve for top executives but private jet use and security are often included. Some companies benchmark such benefits with their peers so they can stay competitive with executive compensation practices, whether corporate jet use, financial adviser assistance, country club memberships or otherwise. But using corporate employees who aren’t assistants for personal matters is more rare and likely requires board approval, he added. Some Meta board members have been frustrated with Ms. Sandberg’s handling of a situation in which she helped press a U.K. tabloid to shelve an article about her former boyfriend, Activision Blizzard Inc. Chief Executive Bobby Kotick, and a 2014 temporary restraining order against him. The matter also became a part of the broader investigation, according to people familiar with the matter. The Journal previously reported the Kotick issue and a spokeswoman for Meta said at the time: “Sheryl Sandberg never threatened the MailOnline’s business relationship with Facebook in order to influence an editorial decision.” Mr. Kotick has said it was his understanding that the Daily Mail didn’t run the story because it was untrue. The probe into Ms. Sandberg’s activities follows a renewed effort within Facebook to boost the company’s regulatory compliance, following a $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in 2019. Facebook hired its first chief compliance officer last year in order to beef up such checks and balances. Some parts of the investigation into Ms. Sandberg’s actions occurred after more stringent compliance practices were put in place at Meta, some of the people said. Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives have sometimes used company resources, including private planes and staff time, to manage their personal affairs as well, according to securities filings, public documents and people familiar with the matter. The reputation and safety of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg have been long seen as inextricably linked to the company’s success. Facebook has hired professional pollsters to analyze their personal reputations, according to people familiar with the matter, because they were seen as connected to the image of the company overall. People close to the executives say many of their activities—and of business executives broadly—aren’t strictly professional or personal but rather a bit of both and enrich them as leaders generally and help the company, including for recruiting. Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg both use private planes for personal travel as part of their overall security program, according to Facebook’s latest proxy. Both executives also receive personal security at their residences as well as during personal travel, paid for by the company. In 2021, Facebook paid nearly $9 million for Ms. Sandberg’s security at her homes and during personal travel and $2.3 million for costs related to her personal use of private planes, according to the company’s most recent proxy. Facebook spent $15.2 million on Mr. Zuckerberg’s security and $1.6 million in private plane costs. Facebook staff assisted Ms. Sandberg during both of her book tours and in the acknowledgments of Option B, she thanked many employees for their assistance in putting the book together. It was also not uncommon for Facebook staffers to help Ms. Sandberg with work involving her foundation and sometimes assist with tasks for her family, according to people close to the matter. Some people close to Ms. Sandberg said it was often more efficient to work that way. Facebook employees also worked on Mr. Zuckerberg’s projects, including his 2017 tour of 30 American states, according to public records. One stop in Glacier National Park in Montana, Mr. Zuckerberg was joined by at least three full-time Facebook employees, according to public records.

Meta_Facebook,*Facebook Deal Spurs Dissent in American Revolution Anniversary Group -- WSJ,7 March 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,434 words",0.9861,0.086,0.04,0.874,"English , Inc. 7 Mar 2022 *Meta's $10 Million Pledge Provides Exclusive Access to Some Anniversary Programs -- WSJ 7 Mar 2022 *Some America250 Commissioners Claim They Weren't Told Details of Facebook Deal -- WSJ 7 Mar 2022 Facebook Gains Inside Role in U.S. 250th Anniversary Project With $10 Million Agreement -- WSJ By Jess Bravin WASHINGTON -- The America250 Foundation, a nonprofit planning the government's observance of the American Revolution's 250th anniversary, has signed a deal with Meta Platforms Inc. giving Facebook's parent an inside role in producing and promoting the Semiquincentennial commemoration in exchange for $10 million, according to documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by the company. The agreement was approved by Daniel DiLella, a Pennsylvania real-estate executive who is chairman of both the foundation and the federal agency it was created to support, the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission. Both entities share a website and together present themselves as America250. The deal was made over objections from staff members, people familiar with the matter said, who argued it gave Facebook too much influence over a government project and provided special access and privileges that could deter other companies from joining as sponsors. The details haven't been disclosed to the full 36-member commission, which Congress established in 2016 to organize observances leading up to July 4, 2026, these people said. ""According to the policies and procedures of the commission, any contracts that include the use of the commission's logo, brand, or identity require the vote of the commission. No such vote has ever been presented or taken regarding this contract,"" said Commissioner Andrew Hohns, chief executive of Philadelphia investment firm Newmarket Capital, in an interview. Mr. DiLella declined interview requests On Wednesday, the commission is scheduled to vote on a package of proposals backed by Mr. DiLella that would provide blanket approval of previous actions the foundation has taken without explicit authority from the federal agency. Other provisions would give Mr. DiLella stronger control over the commission, with power to appoint officers and committee members, limit commissioners' participation in meetings and withhold information from both the public and other commissioners, the proposal says. The proposals are intended to streamline commission operations because there has been difficulty assembling a quorum, the introduction says. It adds that the commission's September meeting, where Mr. Hohns and two other commissioners asked for an accounting of public funds, was marred by ""a lack of decorum and respect for fellow Commissioners."" ""The Governance Committee spent more than 100 hours, including 14 hours in meetings deliberating on comments and suggestions,"" to improve commission procedures, America250 spokesman Michael Frazier said in a statement. The committee members either declined to comment or didn't respond to interview requests. If approved, the package could buttress Mr. DiLella's hold on a project that dissenting commissioners and a lawsuit by former employees claim has been undermined by mismanagement, favoritism and sex discrimination. Mr. Frazier said Mr. DiLella is ""committed to engaging an independent investigator to review these claims"" and hoped to begin a review within 30 days. Mr. Frazier released a statement Sunday saying that America250 followed ""a standard approach"" with the Facebook sponsorship and that the commission's development and executive committees ""were informed during the process. In addition, the full Commission has been informed of this potential corporate sponsorship as well. A larger public announcement has been pending."" Facebook said it was reviewing its association with America250 after The Wall Street Journal reported in February that four female executives had resigned in protest from the organization over what they called a toxic workplace and a coverup of improper expenditures and invoices by a vice president, among other complaints. ""We understood this to be a standard corporate sponsorship aimed at celebrating America's 250th anniversary, which is why we agreed to participate and support,"" a Meta spokesman said. ""We're reviewing this report and evaluating our participation."" The governance proposals come in the aftermath of the commission's contentious meeting in September, during which three members challenged Mr. DiLella's leadership. ""We think it is time for Congress to conduct oversight hearings on the management, hiring, contracting, and financial practices of the Commission and the Foundation, and on how the Commission has spent its federal appropriation,"" $20 million so far, Commissioner James Swanson, an author and former Republican Justice Department official, said at the September meeting, according to a transcript. Some commissioners say they are troubled by Mr. DiLella's latest plans. ""I would not be comfortable with rubber stamping everything that has been done over the past three years,"" former Rep. Joseph Crowley (D., N.Y.), who held a commission seat reserved for lawmakers until leaving Congress in 2019 and was reappointed in October 2021 as a private citizen, said in an interview. The America250 Foundation was created, in part, to marshal private-sector support for the Semiquincentennial. According to an internal finance report that was viewed by the Journal, as of December the foundation primarily was funded by the commission it is intended to support, which had transferred $11.8 million of its congressional appropriations to the nonprofit. The second-highest revenue source was $2 million contributed by an unnamed ""national sponsor."" That sponsor is Facebook, which pledged to pay the foundation $10 million in installments under an agreement signed in June by Scott Hommel, America250's chief operating officer then serving as interim chief executive, and Josh Ginsberg, Meta's vice president for public affairs marketing, the documents show. The contract makes Facebook the Semiquincentennial's exclusive ""social connectivity"" partner, entitled to use America250 branding and to help plan and present the commemorations. It provides Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg a seat on a Semiquincentennial Corporate Leadership Council. The agreement says ""America250 will support Facebook's efforts to catalog National Parks and Landmarks."" People familiar with the arrangement say that clause refers to Meta's virtual-reality product Oculus, which wants to capture images by flying drones over federal property. Meta has asked America250 to arrange meetings with Interior Department officials regarding the matter, these people say. The deal envisions outsourcing some Semiquincentennial observances to Meta. ""Programs and platforms will be detailed to Facebook, and may include vetted influencers and content on each subject designed to encourage discourse among Facebook users,"" it states. The arrangement was brokered by 21 Sports and Entertainment Marketing Group Inc., which receives a 17% commission. The Greenwich, Conn., firm already has received $340,000, the internal finance report says. Anna Laymon, then vice president of programs and planning for America250, took issue with the deal at a June meeting, according to an audio file of the meeting heard by the Journal. ""This seems to me to give Facebook special access to a federal agency,"" she said. Rob Prazmark, a 21 Marketing principal, said in the recording that the arrangement had been approved by Thomas McGarrigle, a friend of Mr. DiLella who is serving as the foundation's counsel. Mr. Prazmark declined to comment. Mr. McGarrigle didn't respond to an interview request. Ms. Laymon, who resigned in September, is a plaintiff in the lawsuit. At a September meeting where America250 executives discussed strategies for recruiting Walmart Inc. as a sponsor, Renee Burchard, then chief administrative officer and chief of staff, warned that Facebook's involvement could be a deal breaker for other companies. ""They're getting some bad, bad press,"" Ms. Burchard said, and ""congressional hearings"" on the company were under way. She cited Journal articles which last year documented social harms linked to Meta products such as Facebook and Instagram. Corporate sponsors want ""a safe, pure, nonpolitical, great place"" to enhance their brands, Ms. Burchard said. ""Facebook would make me go, 'Uh, hold on a minute.'"" ""I think Facebook's a monster. And in a good way,"" countered Thomas Shepard, another 21 Marketing executive. Mr. Shepard didn't respond to an interview request. Ms. Burchard resigned in December and is a plaintiff in the lawsuit. According to people familiar with the discussions, Walmart and several other companies have so far declined sponsorship invitations. Corrections & Amplifications This item was corrected on March 8, 2022 to show that the America250 Foundation was created to support the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission. An earlier version incorrectly said that the commission was created to support the foundation. (END) Dow Jones Newswires March 07, 2022 (14:00 GMT)"
Meta_Facebook,Technology,6 January 2022,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,210 words",-0.9922,0.047,0.096,0.856,"Facebook says it has removed groups from its platform that support violence. Headquarters of Facebook parent Meta Platforms in Menlo Park, Calif. PHOTO: Constanza Hevia H. for The Wall Street Journal A lawsuit filed Wednesday seeks to hold Facebook 's parent company liable in the 2020 killing of a federal security guard, in the latest effort to challenge the protections given to websites hosting user-generated content. In a complaint against Meta Platforms Inc ., Angela Underwood Jacobs said the alleged murder of her brother, Dave Underwood, by antigovernment extremists was the result of a plot hatched on Facebook . Her brother was shot and killed by a man who had traveled to Oakland, Calif., with an intent to kill federal agents, according to federal prosecutors. The lawsuit alleged that the man connected with another individual on Facebook before traveling to Oakland. The two men ""connected through Facebook 's groups infrastructure and its use of algorithms designed and intended to increase user engagement,"" the lawsuit said. A Facebook spokesman said the claims are without legal basis. In the past, the company has said it has worked with law enforcement on the case. The spokesman said the company has banned more than 1,000 ""militarized social movements"" from its platform. The alleged shooter and accomplice have pleaded not guilty to charges related to the murder. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Should lawmakers make it easier to sue companies like Facebook for content people post on their sites? Join the conversation below. The suit, filed in Alameda County Superior Court in Alameda, Calif., is the latest in a series of legal attempts to pierce the broad legal protections tech companies have when communication on their platforms is alleged to have caused harm. Unlike publishers of newspapers and books, internet companies like Facebookare protected by a 1996 federal law , Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, that shields them from liability as sites that host user-generated content. Recently, legislators have been discussing potential changes to the law, including curbing or revoking the liability protection, as some policy makers are concerned about the spread of content they deem harmful. Last year, The Wall Street Journal published a series of articles based on internal Facebook documents showing how much the company knows about flaws in its platform and how often it has lacked the will or ability to address them. U.S. senators held hearings related to the Journal's findings. Facebook has said it disputes the conclusions reached from the documents and that it wants new regulations that will create ""standard rules for the internet."" Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has called for Congress to pass legislation forcing digital platforms to earn the legal immunity they enjoy by demonstrating that they have systems in place to identify unlawful content and remove it. Holding Facebook liable for things its users post online is difficult because of Section 230, said John Morris, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who focuses on internet policy and served in the previous two U.S. presidential administrations. Nevertheless, several lawsuits are set to test the law's protections. In a Texas case filed in 2018, an anonymous plaintiff who was allegedly trafficked for sex as a minor by people using Facebook to communicate is seeking to hold the company liable. The Texas Supreme Court dismissed most of the plaintiff's claims under Section 230 last year but allowed some to go forward, writing, ""we do not understand Section 230 to 'create a lawless no-man's-land on the Internet.' "" The plaintiff asked the U.S. Supreme Court in September to consider the case and is awaiting a response. Facebook has said it is reviewing the case and that it takes action to prevent trafficking on the site. The father of a TV news reporter who was shot dead on video in 2015 has filed a complaint against Facebook with the Federal Trade Commission because videos of the killing have remained on Facebook and Instagram . The reporter's father has argued Facebook is involved in deceptive trade practices by violating its own terms of service in allowing the videos to be posted. Facebook has said that it continues to remove the videos from its site when people post them. The FTC has yet to respond to the complaint, according to Georgetown Law's Civil Rights Clinic, which assisted with the complaint. In the California lawsuit, Ms. Underwood Jacobs said the two men federal prosecutors have charged in her brother's killing came together over Facebook after one of them, a former Air Force sergeant named Steven Carrillo, posted a video on a Facebook group page showing a crowd attacking two California Highway Patrol officers on May 28, 2020. Mr. Carrillo posted the video to a group associated with the boogaloo movement, the suit said. The movement is a loose-knit group of right-wing, antigovernment extremists who often call themselves ""boogaloo bois"" (pronounced ""boys""). Its adherents' views are wide-ranging, with a focus on overturning authority, according to researchers who track extremist organizations. They grew their ranks in recent years on social media, mainly Facebook , according to these researchers. Ms. Underwood Jacobs's complaint said the two men came together on the boogaloo group because Facebook recommended that one of them, Robert Alvin Justus Jr., join the group. One of Ms. Underwood Jacobs's lawyers, Tory Nugent, said that by making group recommendations based on users' interests, Facebook did ""something far different than simply facilitate a bulletin board."" The act of recommending that people join groups that share inflammatory content makes Facebook more than a passive platform protected by Section 230, she said. ""Facebook aided and abetted an act of domestic terrorism,"" Ms. Underwood Jacobs said. ""No one is holding Facebook accountable, and that's wrong."" Facebook has previously said it is working with law enforcement and that it removed Mr. Carrillo's account and several boogaloo-connected groups that have supported violence. Mr. Carrillo wrote in one Facebook group post that the protests against police brutality sweeping the nation in 2020 were ""a great opportunity to target the specialty soup bois,"" a reference to federal agents, according to the complaint. In response, Mr. Justus wrote: ""lets boogie,"" the suit said. Mr. Carrillo and Mr. Justus allegedly made plans to travel to Oakland for a May 29, 2020, protest, according to federal prosecutors. The pair drove in a van toward a guard post outside a federal building in Oakland, and Mr. Carrillo fired multiple rounds at Mr. Underwood and his partner, prosecutors alleged. Mr. Underwood was killed, and his partner was injured. Mr. Carrillo has pleaded not guilty to murder and attempted murder charges. Mr. Justus has pleaded not guilty to aiding and abetting murder and attempted murder.

Meta_Facebook,EXCHANGE --- Apple vs. Facebook: What Made a Rivalry --- The tech giants discussed working together and charging a subscription fee for Facebook,13 August 2022,The Wall Street Journal,"1,629 words",0.9758,0.071,0.02,0.909,"An ongoing dispute over privacy between Apple Inc. and Facebook is roiling the digital economy, leading companies to shift billions in ad spending as users continue to limit the data available to advertisers. The feud took off last year, when Apple rolled out iOS 14.5, a version of its mobile operating system that made it easier than ever for iPhone and iPad users to opt out of letting apps like Facebook track their activity on their devices. The two companies weren't always at odds. In fact, they were almost business partners. In the years before the change, Apple suggested a series of possible arrangements that would earn the iPhone maker a slice of Facebook's revenue, according to people who either participated in the meetings or were briefed about them. As one person recalled: Apple officials said they wanted to ""build businesses together."" One idea that was discussed: creating a subscription-based version of Facebook that would be free of ads, according to people familiar with the discussions. Because Apple collects a cut of subscription revenue for apps in its App Store, that product could have generated significant revenue for the Cupertino, Calif., giant. The companies also haggled over whether Apple was entitled to a piece of Facebook's sales from so-called boosted posts, said people familiar with the matter. A boost allows a user to pay to increase the number of people that see a post on Facebook or Instagram. Facebook, which considers boosts ads, has always contended that boosts are a form of advertising, in part because they are often used by small businesses to reach a bigger audience, said one of the people. Apple, which doesn't take a cut of advertising from developers, argued that Facebook boosts should be considered in-app purchases, according to a person familiar with the matter. Apple's standard terms would entitle it to take a 30% share of those sales. Apple and Facebook, which has since changed its name to Meta Platforms Inc., didn't reach agreements on any of the proposals to work more closely together. Around the same time, Facebook was considering making its own privacy-related changes. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg chose to delay significant changes to its data practices to keep its advertising business humming, the people said, an approach internally dubbed a ""rear-guard"" strategy. The negotiations between the two companies, and Facebook's internal discussions about privacy, haven't been previously reported. They provide fresh insight into the origins of the contentious rivalry that is changing the kind of advertising consumers see online and putting billions of dollars in ad spending up for grabs. Among U.S. iPhone and iPad users, 37% have opted into allowing companies to track them on their devices, according to research firm Insider Intelligence. With so few users opting in, the ramifications of Apple's changes to its mobile operating system have been felt broadly across the digital advertising ecosystem. Among U.S. and U.K. mobile advertisers, 59% have shifted advertising budgets from iOS to Android, Google's mobile operating system, according to a June survey by Tenjin and Growth FullStack, which develop tools used by mobile advertisers. The privacy shift has resulted in $17.8 billion in lost revenue among Facebook, Twitter, Snap and YouTube so far in 2022, according to an estimate by Lotame, a data-management company. Facebook, in particular, is scrambling to patch its ad-tracking systems, after Apple's moves were the primary cause of a sharp business slump that has shaved approximately $600 billion from the company's market value in less than a year. Last month, a little more than a year after these changes, Facebook's parent company, Meta, reported its first year-over-year decline in quarterly revenue since it went public in 2012. In prominent advertising campaigns and public statements from their top executives, the two tech giants have staked out rival positions, with Apple focused on user privacy while Meta highlights the benefits of personalized online advertising. The discussions between the two companies, mostly between the years 2016 and 2018, represented efforts to find common ground in a period before their positions hardened. ""Every day, we meet and collaborate with developers of all sizes to make suggestions, address concerns, and help them continue to grow their businesses,"" said an Apple spokesman, who added that the rules for app developers like Facebook are ""applied equally to all developers because we think that fair enforcement results in the best user experience."" A Meta spokesman said the company has ""made significant changes over the past five years to protect people's data while also allowing businesses of all sizes to grow."" He continued: ""The decisions we make aren't dictated by another company, but by our commitment to the people using our products and our belief that privacy and personalization are not at odds."" Apple and Facebook for years enjoyed a unique symbiosis: Apple controlled the App Store, the gateway for hundreds of millions of users to download the flagship Facebook app as well as the company's other popular services, including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. But while Facebook's products were among the most popular apps on the iPhone, they didn't generate sales for Apple. This was a persistent frustration for some Apple executives, according to the people familiar with the matter. As the iPhone's maker, Apple also controlled device-identification tracking, which for more than a decade was central to Facebook's ability to harvest data on users and deliver personalized ads. Apple says its commitment to privacy is a core company principle that predated its rift with Facebook. An Apple spokeswoman said there is no connection between any discussions of partnerships and the ad-tracking changes that were later implemented. Apple has discussed similar business models with many developers, according to a person familiar with the conversations. The discussions with Facebook came as Apple was shifting its focus away from hardware sales and toward software. After Apple in 2016 saw its first ever year-over-year decline in iPhone revenue, CEO Tim Cook began putting more attention on the company's digital-services business. Revenue from Apple's hardware business declined nearly 1% during its most recent quarter, compared with a year earlier. Meanwhile, revenue for the company's smaller services business, which includes the App Store and its own advertising operation, rose 12%. An important part of Apple's services revenue came from a partnership with Alphabet Inc.'s Google, which wasn't publicly known until it was cited in a 2020 antitrust lawsuit against Google by the Justice Department. Under the arrangement, Google pays Apple billions of dollars annually to be the default search engine in the Safari web browser. Apple hasn't been accused of wrongdoing and Google has said it pays to promote its services just as many businesses do. Some Facebook executives worried about Apple's sway over their business, in part due to public comments by Mr. Cook that were critical of businesses that depended on collecting data about their users. Facebook's use of user data was also increasingly out of step with privacy concerns in Europe, and public stumbles prompted a wave of scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and Europe. That summer of 2018, Apple rolled out changes to its Safari desktop and mobile web browser that hindered Facebook's web business, eliminating its ability to track users without their permission as they visited different websites. The next big target for Apple: Apps doing the same kind of tracking. At Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters, Mr. Zuckerberg and his executives were already considering changes to their business, including the once-unthinkable move to stop using data collected by other companies to target ads to users, according to people familiar with the discussions. The Facebook executives who internally proposed ending the collection of third-party data argued that by ceasing its reliance on such data, the social-media giant could also reduce the company's dependence on Apple and Google's mobile operating systems. Mr. Zuckerberg opted instead to leave the bulk of its data-collection practices in place. The company shut down an ad-targeting option that relied on information collected by data brokers shortly after the Cambridge Analytica data-privacy scandal was reported in March 2018, but otherwise Facebook continued to rely on third-party data to target users with personalized ads. There were a number of reasons for rebuffing the proactive approach, according to some of the people familiar with the discussions. Some in the internal Facebook meetings believed the public would never accept Facebook as a leader in consumer-data privacy. Others worried that if Facebook gave up some of its data collection, there would be no end in sight for what practices the public would call on the company to also shut off. Some believed the hit to revenue would simply be too great. When Apple announced its changes in June 2020, it sent shock waves through the advertising industry and was hailed as a victory by advocates of data privacy. The company implemented the changes the following April. Soon thereafter, Facebook revisited the idea of a subscription version of its flagship app, said a person familiar with the discussions. A subscription-based service would have presented numerous challenges, including whether a person who uses multiple social-media accounts would have an ad-free experience for all of their accounts. Ultimately, the company decided against the idea so as to not undermine its advertising business. --- Tim Higgins and Suzanne Vranica contributed to this article."
Meta_Facebook,Meta's Free Web Has Surprise Cost,25 January 2022,The Wall Street Journal,"1,756 words",0.9937,0.1,0.042,0.859,"Facebook says it's helping millions of the world's poorest people get online through apps and services that allow them to use internet data free. Internal company documents show that many of these people end up being charged in amounts that collectively add up to an estimated millions of dollars a month. To attract new users, Facebook made deals with cellular carriers in countries including Pakistan, Indonesia and the Philippines to let low-income people use a limited version of Facebook and browse some other websites without data charges. Many of the users have inexpensive cellphone plans that cost just a few dollars a month, often prepaid, for phone service and a small amount of internet data. Because of software problems at Facebook, which it has known about and failed to correct for months, people using the apps in free mode are getting unexpectedly charged by local cellular carriers for using data. In many cases they only discover this when their prepaid plans are drained of funds. In internal documents, employees of Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. acknowledge this is a problem. Charging people for services Facebook says are free ""breaches our transparency principle,"" an employee wrote in an October memo. In the year ended July 2021, charges made by the cellular carriers to users of Facebook's free-data products grew to an estimated total of $7.8 million a month, when purchasing power adjustments were made, from about $1.3 million a year earlier, according to a Facebook document. The documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal were written in the fall of 2021 and are not part of the information made public by whistleblower Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager. Facebook calls the problem ""leakage,"" since paid services are leaking into the free apps and services. It defines leakage in internal documents as, ""When users are in Free Mode and believe that the data they are using is being covered by their carrier networks, even though these users are actually paying for the data themselves."" A Meta spokesman said Facebook has received reports from users about data leakage and has investigated them. ""We've continued work trying to resolve the issue we've identified."" He said the company has mitigated most of the problem and that work continues. The spokesman said new versions of free mode are labeled ""text only"" and don't prominently display the words ""Free mode,"" although previous versions still in use continue to do so. He said the company is working on updates. The spokesman said free-mode users are notified when they sign up that videos aren't free. They are supposed to get a notification that they will be charged if they click on a video, but it doesn't always work. He said Facebook is working to fix that. The spokesman said the estimate of the additional monthly data charges isn't based on billing information from carriers. He said without the purchasing-power adjustment the estimated overcharges total a little over $3 million a month. One document, in which employees ask management for additional resources to tackle the problem, notes that the issue is ""Easy to dismiss"" because Facebook's partners -- the cellular companies -- aren't being hurt. ""In fact,"" the , ""it's benefiting carriers by giving them additional $$$."" The unexpected charges are one of several concerns employees have about Facebook's efforts to bring people online in places with limited economic and technical resources, according to the documents. The program, called Facebook Connectivity, is one of the company's flagship efforts to deliver continued growth. Facebook's user growth has stalled in prosperous countries, and almost all of its new users in recent years have come from the developing world. Such countries represent the company's biggest growth opportunity -- poor but populous countries such as Indonesia, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Brazil and much of sub-Saharan Africa. To gain new users, Facebook has invested in programs that get people online by building new Wi-Fi services, extending internet cables to new places and making deals with cellular carriers to let people use a low-bandwidth version of Facebook and some other websites on inexpensive smartphones without being charged for cellular data. (Users aren't charged for data if they are connected to a Wi-Fi network.) The free cellphone-data program would help Facebook gain a projected 10.6 million new monthly users world-wide in the second half of 2021 according to an August forecast, internal Facebook documents say. In Asia, Facebook's top markets have a population of one billion, ""and 50% of this population is still unconnected,"" an executive wrote in a May the Journal reviewed while reporting its Facebook Files series last year. ""We have only scratched the surface"" of potential customers, he said. In the 12 to 18 months following May 2021, Facebook's goal is to increase the number of people in Asia who get online monthly through its initiatives to 10 times the current 1.65 million, the documents say. Another one Facebook goal is to develop a ""proactive, positive narrative"" for the company and improve its ""reputation among key audiences."" The free services launched in tandem with cellular operators are attractive to users such as Zafar Iqbal, a 35-year-old high-school teacher in Muzaffarabad, a city in Pakistan's Kashmir region. Cellular data is expensive relative to wages in Pakistan, and Mr. Iqbal said the free offering lets him communicate without having to pay. Early last fall, Mr. Iqbal said, a friend pointed out that his prepaid data was being depleted after using the free app. Mr. Iqbal said he started keeping track of his data usage. He said he pays between 500 and 600 rupees monthly for phone data -- a little over three dollars. He found that over four weeks, about 100 rupees worth of data seemed to be used up while he was using the Facebook app in free mode. ""Where I'm living, in an underdeveloped country, this is very costly,"" Mr. Iqbal said. His job pays him about $175 a month, he said, so the charges are significant. Facebook documents estimate that in Pakistan, users of Mr. Iqbal's cellular carrier, Telenor Pakistan, are charged for $14,736.96 worth of data each day when Facebook is in free mode. Telenor didn't respond to a request for comment. In total, users of all carriers in Pakistan are being charged an estimated $1.9 million each month for data that is supposed to be free, more than any other country, the Facebook documents say. The documents say the problem is occurring in some two dozen other countries, with the Philippines and Indonesia the two with the largest estimated charges after Pakistan. The documents blame technical problems. Videos, which are the major drains on data, aren't supposed to appear in free mode. But the documents say about 83% of the estimated excess charges come from videos that show up anyway because of glitches in the Facebook software that is meant to strip them out, or notify users of charges if they watch videos that do appear. The documents say the problem has grown substantially in recent months. The documents also show that as part of the negotiations with mobile carriers, the social-media giant lets phone customers buy data plans via the apps. That is easier than having customers go through the cell company's own website or retail locations, and gives people the opportunity to purchase data while they are looking at Facebook, and thereby get access to more Facebook content. The documents call it a way to bring the cellular companies on board with the program and allow them ""to monetize their customers"" via Facebook's free apps. Facebook is also helping companies move customers away from prepaid services to Western-style monthly plans by offering them through the apps. In these plans, which Facebook and the phone companies call ""loans,"" users are billed after they consume the data, and companies consider this a way to increase usage. In Nigeria, one internal , Facebook is helping carrier MTN NG by having its app ""show loans to as many people as possible by increasing loan eligibility parameters."" As a result, Facebook's free-to-use app in Nigeria helps get more people to also pay for cellular data, according to what the an ""upsell analysis."" The practice of pushing the ""loan"" data plans through an app developed to provide free internet service comes with hazards, said Brian Boland, a former Facebook executive who headed programs in developing countries before leaving the company in November 2020. ""The whole point of trying to provide these services is to provide them to people without a lot of means,"" he said. ""The idea of tantalizing people with something that would put them in debt is something that would have made me really uncomfortable."" Facebook's programs to connect the world's poor to the internet have been criticized by academics, open-internet advocates and governments. In some cases the criticism has been that Facebook favors its own services over other websites. Facebook over the past decade has responded by making its free services offer broader access to the internet. In India, the government banned one of the programs in 2016, saying it violated the principles of net neutrality, or the notion that all traffic on the internet should be treated equally, with no preferences given to individual services, the country's telecommunications regulator said. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg defended the project in 2015, writing in Indian newspapers that ""If you can't afford to pay for connectivity, it is always better to have some access and voice than none at all."" In some countries, including Peru and the Philippines, Facebook offers a free-data program called Discover. Facebook says publicly that Discover gives people access to any website, although it can't be used to consume data-intensive content such as video or audio. Internal documents the Journal reviewed cite a University of California, Irvine study that found that while Facebook content is easily available on Discover, content from other websites is not. The documents also reference an internal Facebook audit of the program that found Discover ""is not functioning consistent with our commitments"" to treat all websites equally and allow browsing of text from any website."
Meta_Facebook,*Texas Sues Meta Over Facebook's Facial-Recognition Practices -- WSJ,14 February 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,129 words",-0.9287,0.049,0.071,0.881,"English , Inc. 14 Feb 2022 *Texas Says Social-Media Giant Violated Privacy Protections in Lawsuit Seeking Billions in Civil Penalties -- WSJ 14 Feb 2022 *Lawsuit Seeks Civil Penalties in the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars, Source Says -- WSJ 14 Feb 2022 Texas Sues Meta Over Facebook's Facial-Recognition Practices -- WSJ By John D. McKinnon The Texas attorney general filed a suit against Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. on Monday, charging that the social-media giant's longstanding and now discontinued use of facial-recognition technology violated that state's privacy protections for personal biometric data. The lawsuit, filed in state district court in Marshall by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, seeks civil penalties in the hundreds of billions of dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter. In a statement, Mr. Paxton said the company's capture of facial geometry in photographs that users uploaded from 2010 to late last year resulted in ""tens of millions of violations"" of Texas law. ""Facebook has been secretly harvesting Texans' most personal information -- photos and videos -- for its own corporate profit,"" Mr. Paxton said. ""Texas law has prohibited such harvesting without informed consent for over 20 years. While ordinary Texans have been using Facebook to innocently share photos of loved ones with friends and family, we now know that Facebook has been brazenly ignoring Texas law for the last decade."" Facebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Facebook previously settled another lawsuit over its facial-recognition practices for about $650 million. That class-action suit filed in 2015 was brought under Illinois's biometric privacy law, which is similar in some respects to the Texas law. Both laws require individuals' consent before their biometric identifiers can be captured. In the class-action case, Facebook's lawyers said the Illinois law didn't apply to its method for identifying users in photos. The company also said it had given users the ability to opt out of the feature. Facebook's efforts to dismiss the class-action case were unsuccessful, and the company settled the case in 2020. The Texas lawsuit -- in particular the size of the civil penalties being sought -- points to the impact that increasingly widespread privacy laws could have on big tech companies' operations. After Facebook's settlement of the Illinois class-action case became known, Texas sent its own civil subpoena to the company seeking information about the facial-recognition system. Facebook announced it was ending its facial recognition system last November. ""These procedural protections are particularly crucial in our digital world because technology now permits the wholesale collection and storage of an individual's unique biometric identifiers -- identifiers that cannot be changed if compromised or misused,"" U.S. District Judge James Donato wrote in the class-action case. ""When an online service simply disregards the Illinois procedures, as Facebook is alleged to have done, the right of the individual to maintain her biometric privacy vanishes into thin air."" Texas says Facebook's facial-recognition system ignored that state's legal requirements for capturing users' facial features. ""For over a decade, while holding itself out as a trusted meeting place for Texans to connect and share special moments with family and friends, Facebook was secretly capturing, disclosing, unlawfully retaining -- and profiting off of -- Texans' most personal and highly sensitive information: records of their facial geometries, which Texas law refers to as biometric identifiers,"" the state argues, according to a draft of the complaint reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The Texas law makes it unlawful to capture people's biometric identifiers without their informed consent and prohibits sharing that information. Unlike the Illinois law that led to the class-action suit, the Texas law can only be enforced by the state's attorney general. The Texas law also provides for a penalty of $25,000 per violation. The complaint estimates that at least 20 million Texans were members of Facebook in 2021. The civil subpoena issued by Texas demanded all the materials that Facebook had produced in response to the class-action lawsuit. Facebook's announcement that it would stop using its facial-recognition system cited public concern over the technology. ""We're shutting down the Face Recognition system on Facebook,"" the company said in a blog post, explaining that it would ""delete more than a billion people's individual facial recognition templates."" It said that ""the many specific instances where facial recognition can be helpful need to be weighed against growing concerns about the use of this technology as a whole."" Texas officials say in their suit that they are seeking to recover civil penalties for past violations of the law and that they would try to stop any future improper uses -- suggesting Meta might still retain some of the facial-recognition data it collected. ""Facebook announced, in November 2021, that it would cease use of the face-recognition feature on its Facebook social-media platform,"" the draft complaint says. ""Facebook has made no such commitment with respect to any of the other platforms or operations under its corporate umbrella, such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Reality Labs, or its upcoming virtual-reality metaverse."" In a blog post announcing that it was ending its use of facial recognition, Facebook said that it would ""continue working on these technologies and engaging outside experts...[But] amid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate."" The Texas suit also says Facebook has obtained patents for systems ""where consumers wandering in stores or standing at checkout counters have their faces scanned and matched with their social-networking profiles."" The Texas investigation itself might have slowed at least some of the facial-recognition system's shutdown. Following the company's announcement in early November, Texas authorities demanded that relevant data be preserved while the state investigated. In a follow-up letter on Nov. 10, Texas officials said Facebook had confirmed that Meta ""will not delete any source code related to Facebook's Facial Recognition system,"" and would ""preserve all metadata related to the system"" including data sufficient to identify Texas users, which users had facial recognition enabled, and which users had face templates saved. Facebook said it believed the face templates themselves weren't material and could be deleted, according to the Nov. 10 letter from the Texas attorney general's office. The attorney general's office expressed concern about that, and demanded that Meta not delete any face template information for past or present Texas residents.

Meta_Facebook,Business/Financial Desk; SECTB,7 December 2022,The New York Times,"1,118 words",0.1742,0.074,0.059,0.867,"1 English .  Influential and powerful users on Facebook and Instagram receive ''unequal treatment,'' an internal report said. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, was harshly criticized on Tuesday by a company-appointed oversight board for policies that give celebrities, politicians and business partners special treatment compared with the vast majority of its users. Under a program called cross-check, people with a high number of followers were able to say and share things on Facebook and Instagram that would otherwise have been quickly removed for violating company policies, according to the Oversight Board, which Meta had created to adjudicate thorny policy questions related to free speech, human rights and content moderation. ''The board is concerned about how Meta has prioritized business interests in content moderation,'' the board said in a report. The cross-check program, it said, ''provided extra protection for the expression of certain users.'' The oversight board recommended that Meta overhaul its cross-check system by ''radically'' increasing transparency over who is on the program's list of V.I.P.s and hiding their posts while they are reviewed. Meta should prioritize speech, which is ''of special public importance,'' it added. Recommendations made by the board, which includes about 20 academics, human rights experts and lawyers, are nonbinding. The report was a reminder of the power that social networks have in deciding what posts to keep up, what to take down and how to treat specific accounts. Twitter, Facebook, TikTok and others have long been scrutinized for making unilateral rulings on content on their platforms that can influence political debates and societal issues. Elon Musk, Twitter's new owner, is now in the spotlight for how his social media service will moderate content. Twitter had created policies around keeping misinformation and hate speech off the platform, but Mr. Musk has said he believes in unfettered discourse and has dropped the enforcement of some of those policies. Meta has de-emphasized its social networking business in recent months after criticism about toxic content on those platforms. Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive, has instead put a priority on moving into the immersive digital world of the metaverse. Meta has spent billions of dollars on the shift, though it is unclear if consumers will embrace metaverse-related products. The company recently laid off more than 11,000 employees, or about 13 percent of its work force. ''Meta's oversight board call for a major overhaul of content moderation rules will create more fairness, a level playing field and hold V.I.P. profile users to the same stringent standards of the common user,'' said Brian Uzzi, a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. ''To avoid chaos, there should be one rule to rule them all.'' Nick Clegg, Meta's vice president of global affairs, said on Tuesday that Meta had created the cross-check system to prevent erroneously removed posts from having an outsize impact. He said the company would respond to the oversight board's report within 90 days. The oversight board began investigating the cross-check program last year after its existence was reported by The Wall Street Journal and a whistle blower, Frances Haugen. The board sharply criticized the company last year for not being transparent about the program. On Tuesday, the oversight board found that the cross-check program ensured that high-profile users received additional review from a human moderator before their posts were removed for running afoul of the company's terms of service. The board criticized the company for a lack of transparency and for ''unequal treatment'' of Facebook's and Instagram's most influential and powerful users at the expense of its human rights and company values. Meta took as long as seven months to reach a final decision on a piece of content posted by an account in the cross-check program, the report said. Mr. Zuckerberg had pushed for the creation of the oversight board so his company would not be the only entity involved in content moderation decisions. Since the board began hearing cases in the fall of 2020, it has issued a number of objections to Meta's actions on content. In 2021, the board recommended that Meta restore photographs of postsurgery breasts that the company's automated systems had taken down for nudity reasons. The photos, which Meta restored, had been posted by a Brazilian Instagram user who was promoting a breast cancer awareness campaign. The board criticized Meta's reliance on automated systems to remove posts. The board also considered Meta's barring of former President Donald J. Trump from Facebook and Instagram after the riot at the U.S. Capitol in January 2021. In May 2021, the board said Meta should review its decision to bar Mr. Trump, adding that the company did not have appropriate systems in place to issue a permanent suspension of the former president. Mr. Trump had been part of the cross-check program. The board rebuked Meta for not being ''fully forthcoming'' in its disclosures about cross-check, including which figures were part of it. Mr. Clegg has since said Meta will decide whether to allow Mr. Trump's accounts to be restored by January. Thomas Hughes, the director of the oversight board, said Tuesday's report was ''a significant step in the board's ongoing efforts to bring greater accountability, consistency and fairness across Meta's platforms.'' Other social media companies have sought to replicate Meta's oversight board system. After Mr. Musk took over Twitter, he said he planned to form a ''content moderation council.'' He has not followed through on that plan, blaming activists and investors for pressuring him to follow Meta's model. Meta is also facing the prospect of not being able to show personalized ads in the European Union without receiving prior consent from users. Decisions approved by a European data protection body this week would require the company to allow users of Facebook and Instagram to opt out of ads based on personal data collected by Meta, according to a person with knowledge of the decision. A final judgment, which can be appealed, is expected to be announced next month by Irish authorities, which serve as Meta's main data privacy regulator in Europe because the company's E.U. headquarters are in Dublin. 's cross-check program lets people with a high number of followers say and share things that would otherwise be removed for violating policies.

Meta_Facebook,A-Section,4 February 2022,The Washington Post,"1,410 words",0.9776,0.078,0.053,0.869,"A01 English Copyright 2022, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved For 18 years, ever since Mark Zuckerberg started it in a Harvard dorm room, Facebook has been growing. Through scandals, backlashes, regulatory pressure and competitive threats, it has kept growing - until now. Meta, the new name for the company formerly called Facebook, reported Wednesday that Facebook lost daily users last quarter for the first time ever. While the company as a whole, which includes Instagram and WhatsApp, continued to grow, its flagship social network - the big blue app, as it's known internally - stalled just shy of 2 billion log-ins a day. The news that Facebook may have peaked in 2021 was only the most symbolic data point in a gloomy corporate earnings report that sent Meta's stock into an epic, historic spiral - shearing $220 billion from its value and hinting that the company's reign over online socializing might not last. For investors, the more worrisome signs have to do with the company's struggle to monetize Instagram's short-form video product Reels, its answer to red-hot Chinese-owned rival TikTok; a privacy crackdown by Apple that has limited Facebook's ability to target ads on iPhones; and mounting expenses in the company's dramatic bid to build a virtual reality future that it calls ""the metaverse."" Use of the Facebook app itself had been leveling off gradually for years. And 2 billion daily log-ins is still an enormous, almost incomprehensible figure, greater than the population of any country. But it's not what Facebook was aiming for, which was to connect everyone - the entire world, even the people who don't have Internet access yet. While it's possible that Facebook will resume its growth in some form in the future, the quarterly decline in the social network's most prized metric, known as daily active users, is a sign that Zuckerberg's dream is unlikely to be fully realized, at least in the form he once envisioned. For the average Facebook user, this may not mean much in the short run. The social network remains massive, indispensable for many, and isn't going away anytime soon. This is not Facebook's ""Myspace moment,"" at least not yet. Rather, it's a harbinger of a shift already well underway in Menlo Park, one in which Facebook is no longer the center of Meta's attention or the locus of its most important innovations, but a profitable legacy product to be maintained. That diminished stature may reassure people who worry about Facebook's impact on discourse and democracy, but it could cut both ways: It may mean that building increasingly sophisticated content policies and moderation systems becomes less of a strategic priority over time. Meanwhile, it underscores that Instagram, WhatsApp and, increasingly, Reality Labs - the division tasked with developing virtual and augmented reality hardware and software - are the company's future. Meta will do everything it can to keep them growing, to fend off rivals, and to find ways to squeeze more time from their users and more money from their advertisers. When they built Facebook, Zuckerberg and company didn't just want to build the largest social network. They set out to build something truly ubiquitous, something that everyone would use, something that would become part of the fabric of global society - something that everyone had to use, if only because everyone else was. And they got further than almost anyone could have imagined. Just not all the way. To understand how integral growth was to Facebook's identity, it's worth revisiting a memo that executive Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth, now Meta's chief technology officer, sent to the company in 2016. ""The natural state of the world is not connected,"" Bosworth wrote in the memo, which was leaked and published by BuzzFeed in 2018. ""It is not unified. It is fragmented by borders, languages, and increasingly by different products. The best products don't win. The ones everyone use [sic] win."" Facebook's ""imperative,"" in Bosworth's telling - its raison d'etre - was to be that product that everyone used, the tool that unified at last a fragmented human race in a single, vast network. And the company would pursue that imperative at any cost, even the cost of users' lives, ""because that's what we do,"" he wrote. ""We connect people."" Bosworth later insisted, once the memo had come to light, that he had written it in the spirit of debate, and that he didn't really believe what he wrote. Zuckerberg said the same. Yet the company's actions have borne it out again and again over the years. It wasn't even enough for Facebook to connect everyone in the world with an Internet connection. In 2013, before its user growth began to slow globally, Zuckerberg - who is always thinking long term, always anticipating the threat that's over the next hill - foresaw that Facebook would eventually be constrained by the reality that roughly half the world lacked reliable Internet access. So he devised a plan to connect ""the next 5 billion"" by offering a limited, Facebook-centric version of the Internet free to the world's poor. Called internet.org, and later rebranded as Free Basics, Facebook's moonshot largely missed its mark, making gains in some key markets but falling short in others because of public mistrust, digital nationalism and the company's overconfident approach. Still, Facebook continued to grow as more of the world came online without its help and it started a major push to get more international users in 2014. Even in 2018, when the app's usage in the United States and Canada plateaued for the first time, it was buoyed by growth elsewhere. But Wednesday's earnings report showed that Facebook's ascent has stalled just about everywhere. The biggest decline in daily usage was not in the United States but in a category that it calls ""rest of world,"" including Latin America and Africa. The company added that data plan pricing increases in India last year also contributed to slower-than-expected growth. All of which casts Facebook's dramatic renaming and pivot to ""building the metaverse"" in a new light. Zuckerberg knew before just about anyone else that social media was no longer enough to keep the company on top. Now he's trying to will into existence a grand new vision of a digital world in which we all have second lives that play out through avatars inhabiting virtual spaces and realms. Zuckerberg has a long track record of reinventing Facebook and has been compensating for the big blue app's deceleration for some time. Several years ago, the company realized that it had saturated among U.S. and Canadian users, and it overhauled its core news feed algorithm to prioritize engagement - getting existing users to spend more time on the network. It also bought Instagram and WhatsApp, Facebook properties that are continuing to grow even as the product Zuckerberg built as a college student is peaking. And losing users does not necessarily mean losing money in the short term: Facebook's revenue per user also continued to grow last quarter. To regain its footing, Meta will have to strengthen its focus on growing and making more money off Instagram. It will have to deliver on plans to make its various services more interoperable on the front and back ends - for example, by giving people who use Messenger the ability to connect with sellers on Instagram. Its success in potential growth regions such as Africa, where Facebook is hugely popular, also still depends on broadening Internet access. Less than half of the people in sub-Saharan Africa have smartphones, and many have limited bandwidth on prepaid phones, according to the GSMA, the industry organization for mobile network operators worldwide. Meta reported Wednesday that Reality Labs is growing rapidly, though its expenses are mounting faster. Perhaps someday it will be Facebook's metaverse that connects us all, at last. Yet the end of Facebook's growth era marks a turning point in the history of social media and the Internet. If Zuckerberg couldn't connect the whole world with Facebook, given all the resources and momentum and desire one could ask for, he may have to confront the possibility that no single network ever will. will.oremus@washpost.com elizabeth.dwoskin@washpost.com http://www.washingtonpost.com WP20220204FBDECLINE"
Meta_Facebook,Heard on the Street,3 November 2021,The Wall Street Journal,756 words,0.9909,0.08,0.019,0.9,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary] For all the recent controversy surrounding Meta Platforms's algorithms and their potential to cause users harm, their unique power is irresistible for its real customers: advertisers. Wall Street forecasts total advertising revenue for the company formerly called Facebook will reach more than $114 billion this year, or about 17% of the entire global ad market. That is 10 times the amount projected for social-media competitors Twitter, Snap and Pinterest combined. Last year, the ad revenue Meta generated in the U.S. and Canada was more than two-thirds of the total spent on U.S. television ads and nearly five times the ad revenue for the U.S. newspaper industry. Controversial or not, Meta's family of apps and its 3.5 billion monthly users are too big to ignore. Case in point? Last year, Facebook faced a massive advertiser boycott over concerns about hate speech on the platform. Since then, Meta's platforms have collectively added roughly one million advertisers. Meta now says it has more than 10 million advertisers even as its rivals haven't dared to give recent comparisons. Meta's edge in advertising comes from more than just reach. The very mechanics that make its platforms addictive for consumers also hook advertisers, who value a high return on their investments. Much like other social-media platforms, each time there is an opportunity for a user to view an ad an auction takes place on Meta's platforms to determine which ad to show. Auction winners are determined by two factors: bid and relevance. Meta says its auctions are unique in that they give greater weight to an ad's relevance. Ultimately, Meta subsidizes relevant ads in its auctions, meaning the most relevant ads might cost less to advertisers, even if they see more results. At the end of the day, the ads that are the most relevant keep the most people engaged. The sheer number of advertisers Meta boasts means billions of auctions are taking place every day across the company's family of apps. Think of Instagram's ad platform, for example, as an elite sports tournament: Its ads might seem ""better"" than those on other companies' platforms because, by the time you see them, they have rigorously competed for the prize of appealing precisely to you. For advertisers, the proof is in the pudding. In the second quarter, Meta said it generated on average more than $51 per monthly user in the U.S. and Canada. All social-media companies report returns on users a bit differently, but Meta's stand out pretty much any way you slice them. Pinterest said its average revenue per monthly active user in the U.S. was just over $5 over the same period, while Snap said it generated just over $7 per daily active user in North America. And Meta is improving: In the third quarter, the company said its average advertising return per user in the U.S. and Canada was up more than 85% from the same period three years earlier. There are other reasons why Meta's ads might be driving empirically superior returns. While traditional advertising was about spreading the word on your brand, today's ad game is about conversion. Social-media companies increasingly are turning to direct-response ads -- those meant to get you to buy, subscribe or download something right now. Meta has said direct-response ads are the bulk of its ad business. That compares with a company like Twitter which, as of February, said such ads accounted for just 15% of its mix. The differential explains why you likely find yourself idly scrolling past Twitter ads, but clicking on Instagram's. It is true that Apple's recent privacy changes have made it more difficult for companies to track users' activity off their sites. Ironically, that has helped Meta to justify higher ad prices, even in the face of declining targeting ability. Simply put, brands seem to need more help. This year thus far, Meta's ad pricing has grown an average of 33% -- 22 percentage points more than its average over the past five years. Historically, ad pricing has ebbed as growth in the number of ads served has flowed and vice versa -- a balance likely as deliberate as it is delicate. Facebook can only own its advertisers if it also owns you. page,5043"
Meta_Facebook,A-Section,10 November 2022,The Washington Post,"1,496 words",0.943,0.07,0.051,0.879,"A10 English Copyright 2022, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved Facebook parent company Meta plans to cut more than 11,000 jobs, or 13 percent of its workforce, as it seeks to scale back expenses and transform its business in a more competitive digital advertising market. The social media giant also will cut discretionary spending and extend its hiring freeze through March in a bid to become ""leaner and more efficient,"" Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a Wednesday statement. He called the layoffs ""some of the most difficult changes we've made in Meta's history"" and noted that all employees would soon get an email ""letting you know what this layoff means for you."" Zuckerberg said the company would refocus on priorities such as its advertising business and elevating content from viral creators over friends and family, a strategy that has made the short-form video app TikTok so popular. He said the job cuts affected the entire organization, though teams focused on recruiting workers were disproportionately downsized. ""We're restructuring teams to increase our efficiency,"" Zuckerberg said. ""But these measures alone won't bring our expenses in line with our revenue growth, so I've also made the hard decision to let people go."" The layoffs mark a tumultuous new period in Silicon Valley, with tech giants long known as recession-proof bastions of economic power shedding huge numbers of workers in recent weeks. For years, the companies have grown rapidly and hired at ravenous speeds. Facebook alone expanded its staff by 28 percent, to 87,314, in the 12 months ending in September, regulatory filings show. One of the biggest downsizings happened at Twitter last week, where new owner Elon Musk cut roughly half of the 7,500-member workforce, though over the weekend some workers were asked to come back. On Tuesday, media reports surfaced that hundreds of layoffs were underway at Salesforce, which sells business software programs. The ride-hailing app Lyft, financial services platform Stripe and digital real estate marketplace Zillow have also cut staffers, according to company statements and media reports. Zuckerberg said every worker that was laid off would receive 16 weeks of base pay and two additional weeks for every year worked. The company will also cover their health-care costs for six months. He said that the company had cut off access to most Meta systems for displaced workers but that their email would remain ""active throughout the day so everyone can say farewell."" The layoffs at Meta - which changed its name from Facebook a little over a year ago - come as the company is taking a big gamble on building the metaverse. Part of the hiring boom of recent years has focused on building immersive digital realms accessed through virtual reality, which Zuckerberg says will be the next great computing platform after mobile phones and replace some in-person communication. The company is heavily investing in virtual reality headsets and other technology to try to corner the market. Meta has said it expects operating losses for Reality Labs, the division working on its hardware offerings, to grow even bigger in 2023. Last month, the company unveiled a $1,500 VR headset that it says will transform the ability of workers to collaborate with colleagues and conduct their jobs. That vision has been slow to materialize, in part because the company is still developing the underlying technology and a wider range of applications that would make it appealing to mainstream audiences. While the company dominates the VR headset market, Meta is likely to face significant competition from Apple. Meta operates the social media platforms Facebook and Instagram and the messaging app WhatsApp, among other initiatives. The more traditional business model for its main Facebook app, which relies on advertising, has been hit particularly hard by larger economic challenges. Some digital advertisers have pulled back on spending as inflation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine have created market instability. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, more retailers and shoppers flocked to e-commerce, which increased Meta's revenue - a shift that Zuckerberg expected to become permanent even after vaccines became accessible and social restrictions eased. That didn't turn out to be true, he said. ""Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends, but the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition, and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than I'd expected,"" he said. ""I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that."" Meta is increasingly fending off competition for marketing dollars and users from upstart rivals such as TikTok, the short-form video platform that has taken off among younger generations. This year, the company reported that Facebook lost daily users for the first time in its 18-year history, though user growth later recovered. Last month, Meta reported that revenue fell in the third quarter. And Meta has estimated that it will have lost $10 billion this year after Apple introduced privacy restrictions that forced app companies such as Facebook to explicitly ask users whether they could collect data about their online activity, hurting the social media company's ability to facilitate targeted advertising campaigns. Facebook argued at the time that the new privacy rules would hurt small businesses that need granular information about users to find customers. In the face of those challenges, Meta executives have been warning employees that the company was entering a new era of higher performance expectations and more focus on its biggest goals. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg addressed the laid-off employees in a roughly 10-minute Zoom call in which he largely reiterated how sorry he was to make the ""difficult"" decision of issuing layoffs and ticked off the market pressures the business faces, according to a recording of the call The Washington Post listened to. ""It was one of the hardest calls I've had to make in the 18 years of running the company,"" he said. ""No matter what team you may have worked on, each of you played a role in contributing to the products that billions of people use to connect every day."" Zuckerberg also said the company sought to rein in other costs before resorting to layoffs. ""This is going to add up to a meaningful cultural shift in terms of how we operate,"" he said. Shortly afterward, he held a separate call in which he addressed Meta's remaining staffers, a recording of which The Post also listened to. In addition to many of the same points, he told them he hadn't informed managers about the layoffs ahead of time, because he was concerned about leaks. He also said that some teams were affected more than others, including Meta's recruiting teams, and that its business teams would be restructured. No one else spoke on either call, chat was disabled, and Zuckerberg did not take questions. He told the remaining employees that there would be a company ""town hall"" on Friday to answer questions and a further question-and-answer session with company leaders next week. During a recent call with investors, Zuckerberg touted the company's decision to mimic the strategy that has made TikTok so popular: showing users entertaining content from strangers over posts from their friends and family. The company is also heavily promoting its short-form video product, Reels, on Instagram and Facebook as well as in business messaging. During the same call, Facebook said it plans to slow hiring dramatically and hold its head count next year to be roughly the same as it is now. More than a month ago, Meta said it would stop making new offers to job candidates, sourcing candidates and approving internal transfers while the company reevaluated how best to prioritize its staffing resources, according to a memo posted to the company's internal message board and viewed by The Post. Zuckerberg said Wednesday the company would extend its hiring freeze through the first quarter of 2023 ""with a small number of exceptions."" This summer, Lori Goler, the company's top human resources director, advised managers to implement the ""rigorous performance management"" practices that Meta relied on before the pandemic, such as giving critical feedback to struggling employees. In July, Meta's head of engineering, Maher Saba, instructed engineering managers in an internal memo to identify and weed out their lowest-performing employees. ""If a direct report is coasting or is a low performer, they are not who we need; they are failing this company,"" Saba wrote. ""As a manager, you cannot allow someone to be net neutral or negative for Meta."" Such messages from company executives created a wave of anxiety and resentment among Facebook's workforce. Some employees have worried they could lose their jobs or see their annual bonuses reduced. Others are concerned that an already rigorous corporate environment will grow even more competitive as employees jockey for fewer coveted positions, The Post has reported. http://www.washingtonpost.com WP20221110metalayoffs"
Meta_Facebook,Facebook Marketplace and DoorDash Team Up for Local Deliveries,12 August 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,618 words,0.9819,0.068,0.015,0.916,"English , Inc. Drivers for DoorDash Inc. are now delivering items to consumers purchased online from Facebook Marketplace as part of a new partnership between the delivery app and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc.

Meta and DoorDash tested the service in several U.S. cities in recent months, the companies said. The service lets Facebook users purchase and receive items from Marketplace without leaving their homes. It can deliver items that fit in a car trunk and are up to 15 miles away, people familiar with the plan said. Deliveries would be made within 48 hours, the people said. Meta and DoorDash confirmed the tests and said the partnership is in early stages. The companies have been offering free delivery to entice customers to try the service, according to one of the people familiar with the plan. It couldn’t be determined how the companies would charge for deliveries in the future. For Meta, the idea behind the partnership was to try to get more people, especially younger ones, to use Marketplace more often, according to a person familiar with its plans. Marketplace is a feature within Facebook that lets people sell new and used goods to one another. Facebook has struggled to add younger users, who now prefer rival TikTok. Marketplace has been one of the few Facebook features popular among young people, the person said. Over the past two years, Meta has increased its efforts to expand e-commerce on its social-media apps because it would help it sell ads. The company lost ad revenue over the past year after Apple Inc. changed its privacy policy for iPhones and iPads. The changes, made in April 2021, made it easier for people to stop apps from tracking their devices. That tracking data helped Meta measure the effectiveness of advertisements. Increased use of Facebook Marketplace would help Meta better measure the effectiveness of ads, and reclaim some of the data it lost after Apple changed its policy, because commerce channels provide more-detailed data for advertising. The partnership comes after Meta added DoorDash’s chief executive, Tony Xu, to its board of directors in January. The pandemic served as an unexpected boon for DoorDash, the nation’s largest food-delivery service. The app expanded to delivering items including toothpaste to Tylenol, as spending on delivery surged. It also doubled down on logistics partnerships with retailers including Sephora and JCPenney. Under those partnerships, DoorDash uses its fleet of gig workers to deliver orders placed directly on other websites. Now DoorDash and rival Uber Eats are trying to build logistics businesses that sell speed and convenience, rather than just food. The delivery companies say powering next-hour delivery for consumers and businesses—which includes delivering everything from drugstore staples and alcohol to clothes and cosmetics on demand—is the prize that could sustain their growth. DoorDash’s deal with Meta marks its first foray into ferrying goods between consumers. The companies had been discussing a partnership since at least 2021, according to one of the people familiar with Meta’s plans. DoorDash approached Facebook about a partnership in part to create more work for its drivers, especially when drivers aren’t busy delivering lunch and dinner, this person said.

Drivers for DoorDash Inc. are delivering items that consumers purchase from Facebook Marketplace as part of a new partnership between the delivery app and Meta Platforms Inc. The deal is an attempt to get more people, especially younger ones, to use Meta-owned Facebook, according to a person familiar with the plan. For DoorDash, the partnership boosts its ambition to expand into delivering more than food. Facebook and DoorDash confirmed they tested the service in several U.S. cities in recent months. They said the partnership is in the early stages and declined to share terms of the agreement between the companies. The service lets Facebook users purchase and receive items from Marketplace without leaving their homes. It can deliver items that fit in a car trunk and are up to 15 miles away, people familiar with the plan said. Deliveries would be made within 48 hours, they said.

Marketplace is a feature within Facebook that lets people sell new and used goods to one another. Facebook has struggled to add younger users, who now prefer rival TikTok. Marketplace has been one of the few Facebook features popular among young people, the person said.

Meta_Facebook,Facebook Parent Meta's Revamp Gains Urgency Amid Sales Retreat -- WSJ,28 July 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,053 words",0.9977,0.11,0.015,0.874,"English , Inc. Mark Zuckerberg's efforts to remake Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is taking on a new sense of urgency after the company posted its first-ever quarter of falling sales and little sign of an upturn soon. To help stem the decline swiftly, Mr. Zuckerberg is trying to revamp almost every aspect of the social-media platform's operations, from what content is presented to users, to how digital advertising is delivered, to focusing more on video content. It all adds up to one of the biggest set of changes for the company in years, analysts say. ""Meta is at an inflection point -- what once seemed untouchable is showing cracks,"" said Daniel Newman, a principal analyst at Futurum Research. ""Meta has big problems to solve, and like it has done in the past, it needs to be swift to address them all the while dealing with the fiercest competition it has ever faced."" Facebook, as Meta was called before its rebranding last year, has gone through turmoil before. But adding to Mr. Zuckerberg's challenge is the economic backdrop against which this transformation is playing out. Soaring inflation is weighing on advertising spending and there is stiff competition among platforms for what ad dollars are out there. Ad prices that fell 8% in the first quarter, by Meta's calculation, were down 14% in the April through June period, the company said Wednesday as it reported quarterly results. A year ago, the company reported an increase of 47% year-over-year for its average price per ad. Mr. Zuckerberg, on an earnings call Wednesday, said ""we're focused on making the long-term investments that will position us to be stronger coming out of this downturn."" The company also faces formidable competition. TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media service surpassed 1 billion monthly active users in September 2021, and its usage surpassed that of Meta's Instagram among teenagers in November 2021, according to Forrester Research Inc. To battle back, Meta launched Reels -- a short-form video service not unlike TikTok's -- for U.S. Instagram users in August 2020. More recently, Mr. Zuckerberg in April said that Facebook and Instagram would more actively use artificial intelligence to recommend content to users from accounts that they don't already follow. It is a drastic shift away from how Facebook and Instagram have traditionally operated, which is to show content to users from their friends, family or the accounts that they follow. Using an algorithm to determine what content a user is most likely to engage with is perhaps the most signature feature of TikTok. That was followed by an announcement in May from Instagram boss Adam Mosseri, who said that the service would begin testing showing full-screen photos and videos to users, similar to the layout of TikTok's app. Mr. Zuckerberg said the changes are showing promising early returns. On Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg said that over the past three months Meta saw a 30% increase in the time that users are engaging with Reels. He added that nearly one in six posts in users' Instagram and Facebook feeds come from accounts that users don't follow and are based on AI recommendations. That figure will rise to one in every three posts by the end of 2023, he said. ""I think we're on track here and we just need to push through this one,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said. But the changes have also created a popular revolt among some high-profile users. This week more than 2 million Instagram users liked a post that reads ""Make InstagramInstagram Again"" and ""stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends."" Among the users who shared the post were influential celebrities Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian. ""I need to be honest. I do believe that more of Instagram is going to become video over time,"" Mr. Mosseri said Tuesday. Mr. Zuckerberg addressed the backlash on the earnings call, saying that users will still see content from their friends but insisting that the changes will improve Facebook and Instagram. The social media giant has navigated rough patches before. As it prepared to go public in 2012, Facebook, then still largely accessed on PCs, faced Wall Street questions about how it would deal with the consumers shifting to mobile. The company responded by buying up Instagram for $1 billion and revamping its mobile apps. Facebook found itself in a similar quagmire in 2016 when it was locked in a fierce rivalry with Snap Inc., the maker of Snapchat. The company responded by launching Instagram Stories, a rival to its competitor's most notable feature. Mr. Zuckerberg will be pursuing the latest transformation without one of his closest compatriots. Sheryl Sandberg, who is credited with helping build Facebook into the ad juggernaut it became, is leaving the company and was on her last Meta earnings call Wednesday. Meta also is trying to push through changes while undergoing belt tightening. The company cut its forecast for expenses this year to a range of $85 billion to $88 billion, from an earlier projection of $87 billion to $92 billion. The company also will reduce its rate of hiring, he said, with some teams shrinking. ""This is a period that demands more intensity, and I expect us to get more done with fewer resources,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said. The co-founder last year unveiled new plans for the company as he renamed it Meta, principally around a push to embrace the so-called metaverse, a nascent, more immersive vision of the internet where people would interact. ""I still believe that these projects are important, but given the more recent revenue trajectory that we're seeing, we're slowing the pace of these investments and pushing some expenses that would have come in the next year or two off to a somewhat longer timeline,"" he said on the earnings call. ""Previously challenging periods have been transformational for our company and helped us develop our next generation of leaders, and I expect this period to be no different,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said.

We expect our year-over-year growth in the first quarter to be impacted by headwinds to both impression and price growth. -- On the impressions side, we expect continued headwinds from both increased competition for people's time and a shift of engagement within our apps towards video surfaces like Reels, which monetize at lower rates than Feed and Stories. -- On the pricing side, we expect growth to be negatively impacted by a few factors: -- First, we will lap a period in which Apple 's iOS changes were not in effect and we anticipate modestly increasing ad targeting and measurement headwinds from platform and regulatory changes. -- Second, we will lap a period of strong demand in the prior year and we're hearing from advertisers that macroeconomic challenges like cost inflation and supply chain disruptions are impacting advertiser budgets. -- Finally, based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency to be a headwind to year-over-year growth. In addition, as previously noted, we also continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations. We expect 2022 total expenses to be in the range of $90-95 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $91-97 billion. Our anticipated expense growth is driven by investments in technical and product talent and infrastructure-related costs. We expect 2022 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $29-34 billion, unchanged from our prior estimate. Our planned capital expenditures are primarily driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities. As we discussed previously, this range reflects a significant increase in our artificial intelligence and machine learning investments, which will support a number of areas across our Family of Apps. While our Reality Labs products and services may require more infrastructure capacity in the future, they do not require substantial capacity today and, as a result, are not a significant driver of 2022 capital expenditures. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full-year 2022 tax rate to be similar to the full-year 2021 rate. Ticker Symbol Change to META Meta's Class A common stock is expected to begin trading on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol 'META' in the first half of 2022. This will replace the current ticker symbol 'FB,' which has been used since the company's initial public offering in 2012, and more details on exact timing will be forthcoming. No action is required by our stockholders with respect to the ticker symbol change and it does not affect the rights of our stockholders. Our Class A common stock will continue to be listed on NASDAQ and the CUSIP number will remain unchanged.

Contacts Investors: Deborah Crawford investor@fb.com / investor.fb.com Press: Ryan Moore press@fb.com / about.fb.com/news/ Forward-Looking Statements 2 Feb 2022 Press Release: Meta Reports Fourth Quarter and -2- This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy and regulatory concerns; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; and our ability to manage growth and geographically-dispersed operations. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption ""Risk Factors"" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 26, 2021, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is February 2, 2022, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures: Foreign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2021 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance. Purchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the ""Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results"" table in this press release.

Meta_Facebook,"For Meta, the Metaverse Isn’t <break/> So Extra",4 November 2021,Dow Jones Institutional News,767 words,0.9952,0.095,0.022,0.883,"English , Inc. The third in a three-part series on ’s finances Facebook Mark Zuckerberg’s desire to build a “metaverse” may well have spawned from some formative experience earlier in life, such as reading Neal Stephenson’s 1992 novel that coined the term, “Snow Crash.” But contrary to critics’ jests, that isn’t the main reason his company now has a new mission and a fresh name. Formerly known as Facebook, Meta Platforms Inc. is going full-speed ahead building a metaverse to move beyond the world’s most popular set of social-media platforms. It is a place where Facebook’s chief envisions people will work, play, socialize and—most importantly—spend money as avatars. It is futuristic and fantastical. Mr. Zuckerberg likely also sees it as a financial imperative. Meta is predicted to generate more than $114 billion in advertising revenue this year, but its growth is slowing rapidly. Wall Street forecasts the company’s ad business will grow nearly 37% in 2021, but just under 12% by 2024. Meta’s reported financials, coupled with internal research reported by The Wall Street Journal in September, show that despite its overall dominance in social media, the company is losing favor with its most lucrative user base. The company provides user numbers by geography only for its legacy Blue app, which it said had 1.93 billion daily active users as of the third quarter. The U.S. and Canada comprised just 10% of that user base in that period, but those countries generated 46% of Meta’s total advertising revenue. Meta’s third-quarter earnings presentation suggests a higher percentage of the U.S. population are using Facebook monthly than are employed in any capacity—a stat that might lead you to believe that Facebook is a basic necessity in America. Recently, though, that seems to be changing. As of the third quarter, Facebook’s U.S. daily active user base is flat compared with a year earlier. Facebook’s U.S. saturation rate, according to Meta’s internal research, dated March, is strongest among those aged 18 to 29. On Instagram, the saturation rate among U.S. teens is over 100%. That demographic logged declines over the preceding six months in retention, sessions and messaging on Instagram, according to the research. Teens have also demonstrated declines in production and consumption, which one leaked “worrying.” And it isn’t as though those teens are merely moving from Instagram to the classic Blue Facebook app, either: U.S. teen saturation, defined as those aged 13 to 17, on Facebook is just 41%, Meta’s internal research shows. In crucial developed markets such as the U.S., migration from Instagram to Facebook is low, leading researchers to warn that “we may not reach full saturation with current teens.” Lately, it seems as if more of everyone’s time is spent elsewhere. According to the internal research, third-party data shows TikTok more than doubled time spent across U.S. users of all ages over the past year, while the same metric on Facebook grew just 6%. Competition seems to be hitting Meta from all angles. Just 14% of U.S. teens viewed Facebook’s Messenger as their primary messaging app as of the fourth quarter of last year, according to the leaked research. That compares with 24% of U.S. teens using Snapchat most heavily for messaging and 20% of them favoring Apple’s iMessage. The same research describes U.S. teens’ preferences for Messenger as “way behind” these competitors. Collectively, these data help frame the vision Mr. Zuckerberg laid out for Meta’s future last week as much more than just a founder’s fancy. He was clear on the third-quarter earnings call that Reels, Facebook and Instagram’s video-based TikTok-like feature, will be a crucial growth priority. He was also clear Meta will be retooling all of its apps to optimize for young adults—a shift that he said would take years and may well come at the expense of other demographics. Mr. Zuckerberg clearly sees virtual and augmented reality as the next, next big things for young people. When the time comes, he wants his company to be there from the start, not racing to catch up like it is now with TikTok. Mr. Zuckerberg called the Metaverse “the ultimate dream.” For his company, it is do or dwindle. (END) Dow Jones Newswires November 04, 2021 (17:20 GMT)"
Meta_Facebook,Technology,10 October 2022,NYTimes.com Feed,"2,049 words",0.9777,0.076,0.042,0.882,"English .  Meta’s push to develop virtual and augmented reality technology has had a bumpy year. Last October, when Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, announced that the company would change its name to Meta and become a “metaverse company,” he sketched a vision of a utopian future many years off in which billions of people would inhabit immersive digital environments for hours on end, working, socializing and playing games inside virtual and augmented worlds. In the year since, Meta has spent billions of dollars and assigned thousands of employees to make Mr. Zuckerberg’s dream feasible. But Meta’s metaverse efforts have had a rocky start. The company’s flagship virtual-reality game, Horizon Worlds, remains buggy and unpopular, leading Meta to put in place a “quality lockdown” for the rest of the year while it retools the app. Some Meta employees have complained about frequent strategy shifts that seem tied to Mr. Zuckerberg’s whims rather than a cohesive plan. And Meta executives have butted heads over the company’s metaverse strategy, with one senior leader complaining that the amount of money the company had spent on unproven projects made him “sick to my stomach.” The company’s struggle to reshape the business was described in interviews with more than a dozen current and former Meta employees and internal communications obtained by The New York Times. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about internal matters. On Tuesday, Meta is expected to unveil a new V.R. headset at a developer conference, along with other new metaverse features. The stakes are high for the company, which is racing to transform itself to make up for declines in other parts of its business. TikTok is siphoning younger users away from Facebook and Instagram, Meta’s two big moneymakers, and Apple made privacy changes to its mobile operating system that have cost Meta billions of dollars in advertising revenue. The company’s stock price has tumbled nearly 60 percent in the past year — a reflection not just of broader market turbulence, but of some investors’ skepticism that the metaverse will be highly lucrative anytime soon. In late September, the company announced that it would freeze most hiring, and Mr. Zuckerberg has warned employees that layoffs may be coming. “The pressures Meta’s business is facing in 2022 are acute, significant and not metaverse-related,” said Matthew Ball, an investor and metaverse expert whose advice Mr. Zuckerberg has sought. “And there is a risk that almost everything Mark has outlined about the metaverse is right, except the timing is farther out than he imagined.” In a statement, Andy Stone, a Meta spokesman, said the company believed it was still on the right path. “Being a cynic about new and innovative technology is easy,” Mr. Stone said. “Actually building it is a lot harder — but that’s what we’re doing because we believe the metaverse is the future of computing.” Mr. Zuckerberg successfully overhauled his company a decade ago, getting it to focus on how its products worked on smartphones instead of desktops. He signaled a similar shift last year, saying that investing in the metaverse would allow Meta to make the leap from one technological era to the next. There are some signs that Meta’s bet has put it ahead of competitors. The company’s consumer V.R. headset, the Quest 2, is the most popular V.R. headset on the market with more than 15 million sold, according to outside estimates. Its Oculus V.R. app — which has since been rebranded Meta Quest — has been installed over 21 million times on iOS and Android devices, according to an estimate by Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. But Meta’s future success depends on the company’s ability to bring virtual and augmented reality tools to far more people. Meta said in February that its Horizon Worlds game had grown to roughly 300,000 monthly active users — an increase from a few months earlier, but minuscule in comparison with Facebook’s more than 2.9 billion monthly active users. The company declined to provide more up-to-date figures for Horizon Worlds. Adding to Meta’s woes is that U.S. regulators appear determined to prevent the company from acquiring its way to success, as it did by buying Instagram and WhatsApp. In July, the Federal Trade Commissionsued Meta to block it from acquiring Within, the maker of a popular V.R. fitness app. Meta is fighting the agency’s lawsuit, which it has called “wrong on the facts and the law.” Mr. Zuckerberg, determined to recast his public image after years in the limelight for unpopular decisions about political speech on Facebook, has surprised some employees by making himself the innovator face of the company’s metaverse push. Demonstrations and mock-ups of Meta’s latest metaverse technologies feature footage of Mr. Zuckerberg performing V.R. versions of his hobbies, including fencing and a surfing-like watersport called hydrofoiling. The chief executive recently went on Joe Rogan’s podcast, where he told the popular comedian that building an immersive metaverse was his “holy grail.” His involvement has backfired at times. In August, Mr. Zuckerberg posted a screenshot of his Horizon Worlds avatar on his Facebook page, along with an announcement that the app was expanding into France and Spain. But the avatar’s flat, cartoonish look was roundly mocked. (One commenter compared it to “a 2002 Nintendo GameCube release.”) After that response, Mr. Zuckerberg and other executives directed employees to give priority to improving the appearance of avatars, according to two employees. Mr. Stone, the Facebook spokesman, characterized Mr. Zuckerberg’s reaction to the avatar backlash as “frustrated,” but did not provide additional details. A new version of Mr. Zuckerberg’s digital appearance was fast-tracked, the two employees said, along with updates to other Horizon Worlds avatars that had been in the works. Four days after Mr. Zuckerberg’s original post, he shared that upgraded digital version of himself, conceding that his first avatar was “pretty basic” while the “graphics in Horizon are capable of much more.” One Meta graphic artist claimed in a LinkedIn post, which has since been deleted, that he and his team had designed roughly 40 versions of Mr. Zuckerberg’s face over a four-week period before a final version was approved. Mr. Zuckerberg’s zeal for the metaverse has been met with skepticism by some Meta employees. This year, he urged teams to hold meetings inside Meta’s Horizon Workrooms app, which allows users to gather in virtual conference rooms. But many employees didn’t own V.R. headsets or hadn’t set them up yet, and had to scramble to buy and register devices before managers caught on, according to one person with knowledge of the events. In a May poll of 1,000 Meta employees conducted by Blind, an anonymous professional social network, only 58 percent said they understood the company’s metaverse strategy. Employees have also grumbled about the high turnover and frequent shuffling of employees as Mr. Zuckerberg’s priorities change. Inside Meta, two employees said, some workers now jokingly refer to key metaverse projects as M.M.H., an acronym for “make Mark happy.” In September, Vishal Shah, the vice president in charge of Meta’s metaverse division, wrote on an internal message board that he was disappointed in how few Meta employees were using Horizon Worlds, according to a post obtained by The Times. In his post, which was first reported by The Verge, Mr. Shah said that managers would begin tracking workers’ use of Horizon Worlds, and said that testing their own technology was essential. “Why don’t we love the product we’ve built so much that we use it all the time?” Mr. Shah asked. “The simple truth is, if we don’t love it, how can we expect our users to love it?” Mr. Shah, who declined to comment to The Times, also said in his post that Horizon would undergo a “quality lockdown” for the rest of the year to “raise the overall craft and delight of our product.” As Meta has struggled to grow its metaverse, some at the company have suggested unconventional ideas for bringing in new users. This summer, three Meta employees proposed marketing V.R. headsets to Americans who received student debt relief from the Biden administration, believing it could boost sales of headsets by 20 percent, according to an internal post viewed by The Times. “This is an opportunity for Meta Quest growth, as there is evidence that past Federal Stimulus spurred growth,” the analysis read. It does not appear that the company acted on the advice. One prominent insider who has objected to Mr. Zuckerberg’s approach to the metaverse is John Carmack, a well-known game developer and former chief technology officer of Oculus, the V.R. company Facebookacquired for roughly $2 billion in 2014. He continues to work part time at Meta as an adviser. In a podcast interview in August, Mr. Carmack said the scale of Meta’s metaverse bet — last year, it reported a $10 billion loss in the division housing its A.R. and V.R. units — made him “sick to my stomach thinking about that much money being spent.” He added that Meta’s development of the metaverse has been hampered by big-company bureaucracy and concerns about issues like diversity and privacy. Mr. Carmack has also spoken out on Workplace, Meta’s internal message board. In posts obtained by The Times, Mr. Carmack, who is speaking at the developer conference on Tuesday, criticized features of the company’s V.R. headsets, calling the need to run software updates before using them “extremely bad for user enjoyment.” Mr. Carmack did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Carmack’s criticism has put him at odds with executives like Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, who oversaw the company’s V.R. efforts for years and is a close ally of Mr. Zuckerberg’s. Mr. Carmack, according to four employees who have worked with him, has urged the company to think about the metaverse primarily from the immediate user experience, while Mr. Bosworth has approached it from a longer-term point of view with a focus on business opportunities. As the pressure grows, Mr. Zuckerberg has sent a clear message to Meta employees: Get on board or get out. In a June meeting first reported by Reuters(""https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-meta-girds-fierce-headwinds-slower-growth-second-half-memo-2022-06-30/""), the 38-year-old billionaire noted that “there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn’t be here” and that he’d be “turning up the heat” on expectations and goals, according to copies of his comments that were shared with The Times. Since then, the company has frozen most hiring, reduced budgets and Mr. Zuckerberg asked managers to start identifying low-performing employees. Faced with possible layoffs, some Meta employees have started to convey more enthusiasm for the metaverse. More teams have been conducting meetings inside Horizon Workrooms in recent months, several employees said. But the transition has been rocky. Earlier this year, Mr. Bosworth tried to lead a staff meeting inside Horizon Workrooms, according to an employee who was present. The meeting was thwarted by technical glitches and the team ended up using Zoom, the employee said.

Meta_Facebook,Meta Stock Looks Cheap. That's No Longer a Good Reason to Buy. -- Barrons.com,5 February 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,040 words",0.8812,0.086,0.076,0.838,"English , Inc. ByEric J. Savitz Suddenly, investors are giving Facebook a big thumbs down. Within 24 hours of reporting dismal results on Wednesday night, Facebook parent Meta Platforms lost more than a quarter of its market capitalization, some $250 billion. It was the largest single-day loss of corporate value in U.S. history. And the value destruction might not be over. For Facebook, this is different than the privacy scandals and political controversies that have surrounded the company. This time, the problems are with the business itself. Meta (ticker: FB) offered a first-quarter outlook that reveals slowing usage of its social media apps and troubling trends in advertising sales. Fixing the problems will take multiple quarters, and potentially years. Meanwhile, the repairs will have to be made as the company pivots to the metaverse, a significant gamble on an unproven technology. By the end of a long week of tech earnings (see this week's Tech Trader), it became clear that Meta's problems are unique, and not part of a broader industry downturn. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) posted strong results driven by demand for advertising space on Google Search and YouTube. And on Thursday afternoon -- one day after Meta's nightmarish report -- smaller rivals Snap (SNAP) and Pinterest (PINS) surprised investors with better-than-expected numbers, including Snap's first-ever profit. Amazon.com (AMZN) rounded out the big week of earnings with its own impressive results -- including 32% growth in its advertising business. Those reports helped tech stocks snap back on Friday: The Nasdaq Composite rallied 2%, but Meta shares were flat. The lack of buying on the dip reflects the serious issues Meta raised with its earnings. For the first quarter, the company sees revenue of $27 billion to $29 billion, up between 3% and 11% from a year ago. That would be a sharp deceleration from 48% growth a year ago. Meta said results would be affected by ""headwinds"" to both the number of ad impressions generated by its platforms and by pressures on ad pricing. The forecast came as a shock to Facebook investors who have grown used to reliable growth, even amid controversy. Meta by its own admission is now dealing with multiple issues: slowing usage of the company's core social media apps, tough earnings comparisons, decelerating spending by advertisers that are facing labor and product shortages, and intensified competition from TikTok, the short-form video app owned by China-based ByteDance. Meta's mention of weaker ad impressions was the real shocker. The company said its core Facebook business had one million fewer daily average users in the December quarter versus the previous three months. That has never happened before. The slowdown could reflect people spending more time out of the house after two years of severe pandemic restrictions. Alternatively, or perhaps additionally, it could be that people are simply growing a little tired of social media, and using the platforms a little less. On its post-earnings call with investors, Meta repeatedly pointed to competition from TikTok. Meta is going after TikTok with a competitive service called Reels, which have been pushed across Facebook feeds. But it is going to take time for Facebook to catch up to TikTok's popularity, if it ever does. Meanwhile, the issue is cutting into Meta's revenues. ""On the impressions side, we expect continued headwinds from both increased competition for people's time and a shift of engagement within our apps toward video surfaces like Reels, which monetize at lower rates than Feed and Stories,"" the company said. In other words, competition from TikTok is forcing Facebook to push users into less profitable parts of its platform. On ad pricing, meanwhile, Meta continues to deal with Apple's (AAPL) adoption of tough new rules that limit advertisers' ability to track consumer behavior on iOS devices. Those changes weren't yet in place a year ago, so the comparison will be felt again in the first quarter. ""We anticipate modestly increasing ad targeting and measurement headwinds from platform and regulatory changes,"" Meta said. The company has previously expressed confidence that it could develop workarounds for Apple's changes, which affect ad targeting along with knowing when ads trigger purchases or other consumer behaviors. But Meta now sounds less confident about a near-term fix, saying the Apple changes will trim its revenue by $10 billion this year. Perhaps most worrisome for Facebook is that Snap and Pinterest, rivals that in theory should be suffering a similar slowdown from Apple's changes, didn't report the same issues in the quarter. To be sure, the Meta story still has investor appeal, most notably a cheap stock. After the selloff, Meta trades at a discount to the S&P 500 -- 19.3 times versus 20.3 times, respectively. Meta has also been aggressively buying back stock -- $33 billion over the past two quarters. While those purchases look ill-timed, the buybacks suggest that the Meta board considers the stock cheap. That doesn't mean it can't get cheaper. Meta's risks are growing and they're no longer just about Facebook's legacy business. The company is spending aggressively on its metaverse build out -- capital spending this year is expected to be between $29 billion and $34 billion, up from $19.2 billion last year. No one really knows if the plan will work: How many people want to attend concerts, parties, and meetings in an imaginary world while wearing a virtual reality headset? The metaverse has become CEO Mark Zuckerberg's biggest bet -- and it gives the company a quickly changing risk profile, one that looks uncomfortable even with a cheap stock. Meta's user base is mammoth -- 3.6 billion monthly active users, or close to half the Earth's population. But growth is finally slowing, the advertising business is in trouble, regulators are circling, and the metaverse is in its infancy. For Meta, it's a mega set of risks.

Meta_Facebook,Facebook Says It Is Prepared to Block News Content in Canada,24 October 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,748 words,0.7506,0.085,0.07,0.845,"English , Inc. OTTAWA—Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. has warned Canada it is prepared to block the sharing of Canadian news content—like it did in Australia last year—unless the Liberal government amends legislation that would compel big digital companies to compensate domestic media outlets. The legislation is under review by a parliamentary committee, and lawmakers voted this week to stop hearing further testimony from witnesses. Facebook said it wasn’t given an opportunity to testify, so late Friday it issued a statement outlining the company’s concerns with Canada’s proposed rules—and a warning. “Faced with adverse legislation that is based on false assumptions that defy the logic of how Facebook works, we feel it is important to be transparent about the possibility that we may be forced to consider whether we continue to allow the sharing of news content in Canada,” said Marc Dinsdale, head of media partnerships at Meta’s Canadian unit. Canada’s minister for cultural policy, Pablo Rodriguez, said in a statement officials held talks with Facebook as recently as last week, “yet they continue to pull from their playbook used in Australia.” He added, “All we’re asking the tech giants like Facebook to do is negotiate fair deals with news outlets when they profit from their work.” In testimony before lawmakers Friday, Mr. Rodriguez said the survival of the Canadian news business was at stake without the bill. Facebook’s notice to Canada could trigger the type of high-stakes battle that unfolded last year in Australia over the same issue of compensation for media outlets. Facebook’s move in Australia to block news on its platform ended after a five-day period, with the company and government striking a deal in which officials agreed to ease regulations that effectively required payment in exchange for the social-media company restoring content. Facebook’s tactics drew criticism from lawmakers around the world. According to Australian authorities, as well as Facebook documents and testimony filed to the U.S., the social-media company also took down pagesbelonging to Australian hospitals, emergency services and charities while blocking news content. Facebook representatives said this was inadvertent and due to a technical error. Rachel Curran, Meta’s public-policy director in Canada, said Saturday Meta told government officials about the warning before its publication on a company blog. She said blocking news content “is really not our preferred outcome, and we’re not issuing this as a threat. We don’t want to be in a position where we’re having to think about or talk about removing news from the platform.” Earlier this year, citing the Australia model, Canada introduced legislation that would require digital platforms to make “fair commercial deals” with news publishers, which incorporates print, digital and broadcasting outlets. Should negotiations fail to come to an agreement, the legislation envisages the two sides entering binding arbitration to determine appropriate compensation. Canada’s parliamentary budget watchdog estimates the legislation could generate revenue of about $240 million a year for media outlets, with broadcasters in line for three-quarters of the amount. Meta said the Canadian law presumes the company unfairly benefits from its relationship with publishers, “when in fact the reverse is true.” Meta said Canadian news publishers choose to share links and other content from their websites on Facebook to reach a wider audience, and it estimates that results in free marketing worth nearly $170 million a year. The company said the legislation would require Meta “to acquiesce to a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want to supply at a price with no clear limits. No business can operate this way.” News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Facebook. Meta has told publishers in the U.S. that it won’t renew contracts to feature their content in its Facebook News tab. Michael Geist, an internet law professor at the University of Ottawa and a critic of the government’s online news legislation, said lawmakers need to address some of the flaws Meta is citing. “What matters is that the bill threatens the free flow of information online by legislating the principle that facilitating links to information is something that requires payment,” he said.

Meta_Facebook,Facebook Gains Inside Role in U.S. 250th Anniversary Project,7 March 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,333 words",0.9794,0.078,0.04,0.882,"English , Inc. WASHINGTON—The America250 Foundation, a nonprofit planning the government’s observance of the American Revolution’s 250th anniversary, has signed a deal with Meta Platforms Inc. giving Facebook’s parent an inside role in producing and promoting the Semiquincentennial commemoration in exchange for $10 million, according to documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by the company. The agreement was approved by Daniel DiLella, a Pennsylvania real-estate executive who is chairman of both the foundation and the federal agency that was created to support it, the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission. Both entities share a website and together present themselves as America250. The deal was made over objections from staff members, people familiar with the matter said, who argued it gave Facebook too much influence over a government project and provided special access and privileges that could deter other companies from joining as sponsors. The details haven’t been disclosed to the full 36-member commission, which Congress established in 2016 to organize observances leading up to July 4, 2026, these people said. “According to the policies and procedures of the commission, any contracts that include the use of the commission’s logo, brand, or identity require the vote of the commission. No such vote has ever been presented or taken regarding this contract,” said Commissioner Andrew Hohns, chief executive of Philadelphia investment firm Newmarket Capital, in an interview. Mr. DiLella declined interview requests On Wednesday, the commission is scheduled to vote on a package of proposals backed by Mr. DiLella that would provide blanket approval of previous actions the foundation has taken without explicit authority from the federal agency. Other provisions would give Mr. DiLella stronger control over the commission, with power to appoint officers and committee members, limit commissioners’ participation in meetings and withhold information from both the public and other commissioners, the proposal says. The proposals are intended to streamline commission operations because there has been difficulty assembling a quorum, the introduction says. It adds that the commission’s September meeting, where Mr. Hohns and two other commissioners asked for an accounting of public funds, was marred by “a lack of decorum and respect for fellow Commissioners.” “The Governance Committee spent more than 100 hours, including 14 hours in meetings deliberating on comments and suggestions,” to improve commission procedures, America250 spokesman Michael Frazier said in a statement. The committee members either declined to comment or didn’t respond to interview requests. If approved, the package could buttress Mr. DiLella’s hold on a project that dissenting commissioners and a lawsuit by former employees claim has been undermined by mismanagement, favoritism and sex discrimination. Mr. Frazier said Mr. DiLella is “committed to engaging an independent investigator to review these claims” and hoped to begin a review within 30 days. Mr. Frazier released a statement Sunday saying that America250 followed “a standard approach” with the Facebook sponsorship and that the commission’s development and executive committees “were informed during the process. In addition, the full Commission has been informed of this potential corporate sponsorship as well. A larger public announcement has been pending.” Facebook said it was reviewing its association with America250 after The Wall Street Journal reported in February that four female executives had resigned in protest from the organization over what they called a toxic workplace and a coverup of improper expenditures and invoices by a vice president, among other complaints. “We understood this to be a standard corporate sponsorship aimed at celebrating America’s 250th anniversary, which is why we agreed to participate and support,” a Meta spokesman said. “We’re reviewing this report and evaluating our participation.” The governance proposals come in the aftermath of the commission’s contentious meeting in September, during which three members challenged Mr. DiLella’s leadership. “We think it is time for Congress to conduct oversight hearings on the management, hiring, contracting, and financial practices of the Commission and the Foundation, and on how the Commission has spent its federal appropriation,” $20 million so far, Commissioner James Swanson, an author and former Republican Justice Department official, said at the September meeting, according to a transcript. Some commissioners say they are troubled by Mr. DiLella’s latest plans. “I would not be comfortable with rubber stamping everything that has been done over the past three years,” former Rep. Joseph Crowley (D., N.Y.), who held a commission seat reserved for lawmakers until leaving Congress in 2019 and was reappointed in October 2021 as a private citizen, said in an interview. The America250 Foundation was created, in part, to marshal private-sector support for the Semiquincentennial. According to an internal finance report that was viewed by the Journal, as of December the foundation primarily was funded by the commission it is intended to support, which had transferred $11.8 million of its congressional appropriations to the nonprofit. The second-highest revenue source was $2 million contributed by an unnamed “national sponsor.” That sponsor is Facebook, which pledged to pay the foundation $10 million in installments under an agreement signed in June by Scott Hommel, America250’s chief operating officer then serving as interim chief executive, and Josh Ginsberg, Meta’s vice president for public affairs marketing, the documents show. The contract makes Facebook the Semiquincentennial’s exclusive “social connectivity” partner, entitled to use America250 branding and to help plan and present the commemorations. It provides Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg a seat on a Semiquincentennial Corporate Leadership Council. The agreement says “America250 will support Facebook’s efforts to catalog National Parks and Landmarks.” People familiar with the arrangement say that clause refers to Meta’s virtual-reality product Oculus, which wants to capture images by flying drones over federal property. Meta has asked America250 to arrange meetings with Interior Department officials regarding the matter, these people say. The deal envisions outsourcing some Semiquincentennial observances to Meta. “Programs and platforms will be detailed to Facebook, and may include vetted influencers and content on each subject designed to encourage discourse among Facebook users,” it states. The arrangement was brokered by 21 Sports and Entertainment Marketing Group Inc., which receives a 17% commission. The Greenwich, Conn., firm already has received $340,000, the internal finance report says. Anna Laymon, then vice president of programs and planning for America250, took issue with the deal at a June meeting, according to an audio file of the meeting heard by the Journal. “This seems to me to give Facebook special access to a federal agency,” she said. Rob Prazmark, a 21 Marketing principal, said in the recording that the arrangement had been approved by Thomas McGarrigle, a friend of Mr. DiLella who is serving as the foundation’s counsel. Mr. Prazmark declined to comment. Mr. McGarrigle didn’t respond to an interview request. Ms. Laymon, who resigned in September, is a plaintiff in the lawsuit. At a September meeting where America250 executives discussed strategies for recruiting Walmart Inc. as a sponsor, Renee Burchard, then chief administrative officer and chief of staff, warned that Facebook’s involvement could be a deal breaker for other companies. “They’re getting some bad, bad press,” Ms. Burchard said, and “congressional hearings” on the company were under way. She cited Journal articles which last year documented social harms linked to Meta products such as Facebook and Instagram. Corporate sponsors want “a safe, pure, nonpolitical, great place” to enhance their brands, Ms. Burchard said. “Facebook would make me go, ‘Uh, hold on a minute.’” “I think Facebook’s a monster. And in a good way,” countered Thomas Shepard, another 21 Marketing executive. Mr. Shepard didn’t respond to an interview request. Ms. Burchard resigned in December and is a plaintiff in the lawsuit. According to people familiar with the discussions, Walmart and several other companies have so far declined sponsorship invitations. (END) Dow Jones Newswires March 07, 2022 (14:20 GMT)"
Meta_Facebook,A-Section,31 March 2022,The Washington Post,"1,805 words",-0.9127,0.059,0.065,0.876,"A01 English Copyright 2022, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved Facebook parent company Meta is paying one of the biggest Republican consulting firms in the country to orchestrate a nationwide campaign seeking to turn the public against TikTok. The campaign includes placing op-eds and letters to the editor in major regional news outlets, promoting dubious stories about alleged TikTok trends that actually originated on Facebook, and pushing to draw political reporters and local politicians into helping take down its biggest competitor. These bare-knuckle tactics, long commonplace in the world of politics, have become increasingly noticeable within a tech industry where companies vie for cultural relevance and come at a time when Facebook is under pressure to win back young users. Employees with the firm, Targeted Victory, worked to undermine TikTok through a nationwide media and lobbying campaign portraying the fast-growing app, owned by the Beijing-based company ByteDance, as a danger to American children and society, according to internal emails shared with The Washington Post. Targeted Victory needs to ""get the message out that while Meta is the current punching bag, TikTok is the real threat especially as a foreign owned app that is #1 in sharing data that young teens are using,"" a director for the firm wrote in a February email. Campaign operatives were also encouraged to use TikTok's prominence as a way to deflect from Meta's own privacy and antitrust concerns. ""Bonus point if we can fit this into a broader message that the current bills/proposals aren't where [state attorneys general] or members of Congress should be focused,"" a Targeted Victory staffer wrote. The emails, which have not been previously reported, show the extent to which Meta and its partners will use opposition-research tactics on the Chinese-owned, multibillion-dollar rival, which has become one of the most downloaded apps in the world, often outranking even Meta's popular Facebook and Instagram apps. In an internal report last year leaked by the whistleblower Frances Haugen, Facebook researchers said that teens were spending ""2-3X more time"" on TikTok than Instagram and that Facebook's popularity among young people had plummeted. Targeted Victory declined to respond to questions about the campaign, saying only that it has represented Meta for several years and is ""proud of the work we have done."" In one email, a Targeted Victory director asked for ideas on local political reporters who could serve as a ""back channel"" for anti-TikTok messages, saying the firm ""would definitely want it to be hands off."" In other emails, Targeted Victory urged partners to push stories to local media tying TikTok to dangerous teen trends in an effort to show the app's purported harms. ""Any local examples of bad TikTok trends/stories in your markets?"" a Targeted Victory staffer asked. ""Dream would be to get stories with headlines like 'From dances to danger: how TikTok has become the most harmful social media space for kids,' "" the staffer wrote. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone defended the campaign by saying, ""We believe all platforms, including TikTok, should face a level of scrutiny consistent with their growing success."" A TikTok spokesperson said the company is ""deeply concerned"" about ""the stoking of local media reports on alleged trends that have not been found on the platform."" Targeted Victory worked to amplify negative TikTok coverage through a Google ""Bad TikTok Clips,"" which was shared internally and included links to dubious local news stories citing TikTok as the origin of dangerous teen trends. Local operatives working with the firm were encouraged to promote these alleged TikTok trends in their own markets to put pressure on lawmakers to act. One trend Targeted Victory sought to enhance through its work was the ""devious licks"" challenge, which showed students vandalizing school property. Through the ""Bad TikTok Clips"" document, the firm pushed stories about the ""devious licks"" challenge in local media across Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Washington, D.C. That trend led Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) to write a letter in September calling on TikTok executives to testify in front of a Senate subcommittee, saying the app had been ""repeatedly misused and abused to promote behavior and actions that encourage harmful and destructive acts."" But according to an investigation by Anna Foley at the podcast network Gimlet, rumors of the ""devious licks"" challenge initially spread on Facebook, not TikTok. In October, Targeted Victory worked to spread rumors of the ""Slap a Teacher TikTok challenge"" in local news, touting a local news report on the alleged challenge in Hawaii. In reality, no such challenge existed on TikTok. Again, the rumor started on Facebook, according to a series of Facebook posts first documented by Insider. The firm worked to use both genuine concerns and unfounded anxieties to cast doubt about the popular app. One email outlining recent negative TikTok stories mixed reasonable questions, largely about TikTok's corporate ownership and practices, with more exaggerated stories about young users recording themselves behaving badly - the kinds of social media panics that have long bedeviled big social networks, including Facebook. The agency was working at the same time to get ""proactive coverage"" about Facebook into local newspapers, radio segments and TV broadcasts, including submitting letters and opinion pieces speaking glowingly of Facebook's role in, for instance, supporting Black-owned businesses. Those letters did not mention the Meta-funded firm's involvement. Targeted Victory has contracted with dozens of public relations firms across the United States to help sway public opinion against TikTok. In addition to planting local news stories, the firm has helped place op-eds targeting TikTok around the country, especially in key congressional districts. On March 12, a letter to the editor that Targeted Victory officials helped orchestrate ran in the Denver Post. The letter, from a ""concerned"" ""new parent,"" claimed that TikTok was harmful to children's mental health, raised concerns over its data privacy practices and said that ""many people even suspect China is deliberately collecting behavioral data on our kids."" The letter also issued support for Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser's choice to join a coalition of state attorneys general investigating TikTok's impact on American youths, putting political pressure on the company. A very similar letter to the editor, drafted by Targeted Victory, ran that same day in the Des Moines Register. The piece linked to negative stories about TikTok that Targeted Victory had previously sought to amplify. The letter was signed by Mary McAdams, chair of the Ankeny Area Democrats. Targeted Victory touted McAdams's credentials in an email on March 7. ""[McAdams's] name on this [letter to the editor] will carry a lot of weight with legislators and stakeholders,"" a Targeted Victory director wrote. The email then encouraged partners across other states to look for opportunities to add to the campaign, ""especially if your state AG suddenly joins on."" The authors of the two letters did not respond to calls or emails requesting comment. In an email sent last week to local contractors, Targeted Victory asked each team to ""be prepared to share the op-ed they're working on right now."" ""Colorado and Iowa - Can you talk about the TikTok Op-eds you both got?"" a Targeted Victory representative asked. The emails show how the firm has effectively promoted its anti-TikTok messaging without revealing that it came from a firm working on Meta's behalf. None of the op-eds or letters to the editor were published with any indication that the Meta-funded group had been involved. Launched as a Republican digital consulting firm by Zac Moffatt, a digital director for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, Targeted Victory has routinely advised Facebook officials over the years, including during a high-profile congressional hearing after the 2016 election. The Arlington, Va.-based firm advertises on its website that it brings ""a right-of-center perspective to solve marketing challenges"" and can deploy field teams ""anywhere in the country within 48 hours."" The firm is one of the biggest recipients of Republican campaign spending, earning more than $237 million in 2020, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets. Its biggest payments came from national GOP congressional committees and America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC. In 2020, the firm said it was expanding its ""crisis practice and corporate affairs offerings"" because of its clients' growing need for ""issues management and executive positioning,"" adding that it would focus its efforts toward ""authentic storytelling"" with a ""hyperlocal approach."" Some of the emails targeting TikTok were sent in February, shortly after Meta announced that Facebook had lost users for the first time in its 18-year history. Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told investors then that TikTok was a major obstacle, saying, ""People have a lot of choices for how they want to spend their time, and apps like TikTok are growing very quickly."" The company has unveiled a TikTok clone, a short-video feature called Reels, and promotes it heavily in its Instagram app. In a 2019 speech at Georgetown University, during which he invoked the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and championed Facebook's role in promoting free speech, Zuckerberg criticized TikTok for reports it had banned discussion of topics deemed subversive by the Chinese government, saying, ""Is that the Internet that we want?"" (The Washington Post and the Guardian had previously highlighted those content-moderation rules. TikTok has said those guidelines were outdated and that its U.S. business now operates under different rules than its Chinese counterpart.) But Zuckerberg has also pointed at TikTok to counter concerns that Facebook holds a monopoly on social media. TikTok is the ""fastest-growing app,"" he said in his opening remarks at a hearing of the House antitrust subcommittee in 2020. The anti-TikTok campaign follows in a long line of Facebook-funded advocacy groups working to boost its standing in the public eye. In 2018, Facebook worked with Definers Public Affairs, another Washington consulting firm founded by Republican political veterans, to lash out at critics and other tech companies, including Apple and Google, during the Cambridge Analytica scandal that sparked global outrage over Facebook's privacy rules. (The company said it stopped working with Definers shortly after a New York Times report on the arrangement.) And in 2019, as the company faced antitrust scrutiny over its gargantuan impact, Facebook drove the creation of a political advocacy group, American Edge, designed to persuade Washington lawmakers that Silicon Valley was critical to the U.S. economy - and that overt regulation could weaken the country's competitiveness in a technology race against China. Meta outspends all but six of the nation's biggest companies and industry groups in federal lobbying, paying more than $20 million last year, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets. http://www.washingtonpost.com WP20220331TIKTOKMETA"
Meta_Facebook,Business/Financial Desk; SECTB,2 June 2022,The New York Times,"1,358 words",0.8603,0.064,0.042,0.894,"1 English .  The longtime chief operating officer of Facebook's parent company, Ms. Sandberg has had a lower profile during Mark Zuckerberg's pursuit of the so-called metaverse. When Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, recruited a Google executive named Sheryl Sandberg to his social network in 2008, he said he had hired her because ''she has just about the most relevant industry experience for Facebook, especially since we need to scale our operations and scale them globally.'' Ms. Sandberg answered in kind. ''The opportunity to help another young company to grow into a global leader is the opportunity of a lifetime,'' she said at the time. Mr. Zuckerberg was 23, and Ms. Sandberg was 38. Today Mr. Zuckerberg is the same age that Ms. Sandberg was when he brought her on board, and Facebook has ballooned into a behemoth. Over the past year, Mr. Zuckerberg has begun taking the social network into a new direction -- toward the immersive online world of the so-called metaverse -- and renamed the company Meta. And Ms. Sandberg, 52, has increasingly lowered her profile as Mr. Zuckerberg has taken over more of her responsibilities and reorganized the company for its new chapter. On Wednesday, Ms. Sandberg said she was leaving Meta -- which also owns Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger -- this fall. In an interview, she said she had expected to be at the company only for roughly five years rather than the 14 she has served. She added that she planned to focus on her personal philanthropy and her foundation, Lean In, and that this summer she would marry Tom Bernthal, a television producer. ''I believe in this company,'' said Ms. Sandberg, who will remain on Meta's board. ''Have we gotten everything right? Absolutely not. Have we learned and listened and grown and invested where we need to? This team has and will.'' Ms. Sandberg's decision to leave Meta was her own, and she informed Mr. Zuckerberg in a phone call over the weekend, two of her employees said. Ms. Sandberg wanted Mr. Zuckerberg, who was in Hawaii, to be the first to know, one of the people said. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg praised Ms. Sandberg, saying it was ''unusual for a business partnership like ours to last so long.'' He named Javier Olivan, a longtime product executive who has overseen much of Facebook's growth over the past decade, as Meta's next chief operating officer. Ms. Sandberg is ending her tenure at Meta far from the reputational pinnacle she reached last decade. A Harvard graduate who served as the chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers during the Clinton administration, she made her name in Silicon Valley by helping to build Google's nascent targeted ads business into a multibillion-dollar juggernaut. After joining Facebook, she developed its advertising business and was regarded as the adult in the room. Ms. Sandberg helped create some of Facebook's advertising formats for desktop computers, before successfully building its mobile advertising strategy. By 2016, Facebook's revenue was $27.6 billion, compared with the $153 million it generated in 2007 before Ms. Sandberg joined. The ads business remains Meta's main financial engine. Ms. Sandberg's reputation grew with the 2013 publication of her feminist business book, ''Lean In,'' a manifesto for working women based on her experience in government and business. It became a best seller and launched her personal brand, though some critics said Ms. Sandberg's advice came from a life of privilege. But after the 2016 presidential election, Facebook faced intense scrutiny for how it was misused to stoke division and to spread misinformation. Ms. Sandberg, who was responsible for the policy and security team at the company during that election, initially ignored the issues and then delayed a public response. In 2018, the social network also became embroiled in a privacy scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling firm that improperly used Facebook data. Ms. Sandberg, who was in charge of public relations, was held responsible for the fallout and muddled response on the matter. Though they presented a unified front to the public, Mr. Zuckerberg grew frustrated with Ms. Sandberg's responses to the crises. Ms. Sandberg privately told members of her staff that she didn't agree with some of his decisions on content. Mr. Zuckerberg, who holds the majority of voting shares at the company, became more engaged in policy. He made final decisions on speech, including the decision in 2021 to remove President Donald J. Trump from the site after the Jan. 6 riots. He also began taking a higher public profile and over time assumed more of a role overseeing different parts of the company, some of which had been under Ms. Sandberg's sole purview. Questions about toxic content, privacy and antitrust violations continued to dog the company, which nonetheless reached a market value of $1 trillion. Ms. Sandberg flirted with leaving Facebook. In 2016, she told colleagues that if Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, won the White House she would most likely assume a job in Washington, three people who spoke to her about the move at the time said. In 2018, after revelations about Cambridge Analytica and Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, she again told colleagues that she was considering leaving but did not want to do so when the company was in crisis. Last year, Mr. Zuckerberg said his company was making a new bet and was going all in on the metaverse, which he called ''the successor to the mobile internet.'' In his announcement, Ms. Sandberg made only a cameo, while other executives were more prominently featured. As Mr. Zuckerberg overhauled the company to focus on the metaverse, some of Ms. Sandberg's responsibilities were spread among other executives. Nick Clegg, the president of global affairs and a former British deputy prime minister, became the company's chief spokesman, a role that Ms. Sandberg had once taken. In February, Mr. Clegg was promoted to president of global affairs for Meta. Ms. Sandberg's profile dimmed. She concentrated on building the ads business and growing the number of small businesses on Facebook. She was also focused on personal matters. Dave Goldberg, her husband, had died unexpectedly in 2015. (Ms. Sandberg's second book, ''Option B,'' was about dealing with grief.) She later met Mr. Bernthal, and he and his three children moved to her Silicon Valley home from Southern California during the pandemic. Ms. Sandberg, who had two children with Mr. Goldberg, was focused on integrating the families and planning for her summer wedding, a person close to her said. Meta's transition to the metaverse has not been easy. The company has spent heavily on metaverse products while its advertising business has stumbled, partly because privacy changes made by Apple have hurt targeted advertising. In February, Meta's market value plunged more than $230 billion, its biggest one-day wipeout, after it reported financial results that showed it was struggling to make the leap to the metaverse. In the interview, Ms. Sandberg said Meta faced near-term challenges but would weather the storm, as it had during past challenges. ''When we went public, we had no mobile ads,'' Ms. Sandberg said, citing the company's rapid transition from desktop computers to smartphones last decade. ''We have done this before.'' She added that joining Facebook back in 2008 was the ''honor and privilege of a lifetime.'' In his Facebook post on Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg said Ms. Sandberg had been crucial to his company's success. ''Sheryl architected our ads business, hired great people, forged our management culture, and taught me how to run a company,'' he said. He added: ''It's the end of an era.''

Gone, several investors said, are the days in which the stocks logged a simultaneous ascent and attracted crowds of fans. Some have become victims of rising interest rates, changing consumer tastes and stretched valuations. Those that have fallen short of high investor expectations have paid dearly in the market. For the past three years, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. recorded big, simultaneous gains. So far in 2022, all five have fallen. The NYSE FANG+ Index, which tracks those popular stocks alongside a handful of others, has declined 10% this year, underperforming the broader market. Some stocks in the group, like Netflix and Meta, are off at least 38% from their highs. The S&P 500, in contrast, is down 6.2% from its record. ""As a group, it was very strong over the past 10+ years,"" said Amy Kong, chief investment officer of Barrett Asset Management. ""At this juncture, you are starting to see some cracks."" One of the biggest ruptures came after Meta's disappointing earnings report when investors shaved more than $230 billion off the social-media giant's market value, the biggest-ever loss for a U.S. company in a single session. Ms. Kong said she holds shares of Meta and other tech giants but has looked for opportunities to unload shares of the Facebook parent. She has remained optimistic on other tech heavyweights and encouraged by some of the other earnings reports. Instead of the blockbuster growth recorded in years prior, some tech executives are warning of a slowdown. Meta cautioned people were spending less time on its more-lucrative services, and it expects revenue growth to slow. Netflix executives said the streaming-video company would add fewer subscribers this quarter than many had expected. Netflix shares dropped 22% in the following session, their biggest one-day fall since 2012. The recent declines are a sharp shift from their big gains during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, when, like Facebook, the shares soared as a beneficiary of the stay-at-home trade. Earnings season isn't the only factor spurring turbulence in tech stocks. The sector has been roiled since the beginning of the year, as many investors have prepared for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and positioned for other corners of the market to flourish. That has pushed bond yields to the highest level since 2019 and led investors to flee the tech sector in particular. Higher yields can make these stocks less attractive because they reduce the value that investors place on their future earnings. In the coming days, investors will be parsing quarterly reports from tech companies like Twitter Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. for signs of slowing growth. ""You are starting to see that, as a group, maybe that momentum is subsiding to a degree,"" Ms. Kong said. But, she added, ""this group is ever-evolving."" In recent years, other acronyms have emerged to capture the hottest stocks of the moment, like Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. Those shares helped propel the S&P 500 last year, contributing to more of its roughly 29% return than Amazon and Netflix, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Some investors even dispute Netflix's place among the heavyweights. This year, Netflix and Facebook have lost around 30% each. Amazon shares remain down 5.4% even after Friday's giant gains. Apple and Alphabet have lost 2.9% and 1.1%, respectively, outperforming the broader market. There are signs individual investors are pivoting to other trades and buying the dips in some of the tech stocks. Over the past week, several of the tech heavyweights have rebounded. The NYSE FANG+ index added 3.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outperformed the S&P 500. By one measure, Tesla Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia recently recorded the biggest net inflows among individual investors than at any point since September 2020. Investors have favored that trio over stocks like Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, according to Vanda Research. ""You can't just throw a dart at the wall at a tech name and it's going to do really, really well,"" said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co., which owns shares of the tech heavyweights. ""The mentality has changed significantly. It used to be, just buy FAANG."" ""Well, half the FAANG stocks aren't doing very well,"" Mr. Morgan said. Defenders of a modified FAANG strategy, which includes Microsoft alongside Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet, point out that holding all six stocks at market weightings this year would have cushioned some of the blow that tech investors have suffered. The market-weighted portfolio is down 8.1% this year, compared with a roughly 10% decline in the Nasdaq Composite and a 13% drop in an equal-weighted portfolio of those six stocks, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The relative strength of the market-weighted portfolio in part reflects the stronger performance this year of some of the largest stocks in the basket, Apple, Alphabet and Amazon. Amazon's strong results Thursday -- when it said its profit nearly doubled in the holiday period -- led to a 14% pop in the stock Friday that helped send the broader market higher to end the week. The move added $191 billion in market value, making it almost as dramatic as Facebook's decline a day prior."
Meta_Facebook,Facebook Parent Meta's Earnings Fall Short as Revenue Decline Accelerates -- 2nd Update,26 October 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,851 words,0.9781,0.088,0.05,0.862,"English , Inc. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. posted its second revenue decline in a row, as the social-media giant wrestles with a vortex of challenging business conditions that have combined to shave more than half a trillion dollars from its market value so far this year. The company reported quarterly revenue of $27.7 billion, down more than 4% from a year ago, after posting a 1% decrease last quarter. Meta's share price fell more than 5% on Wednesday, amid a broad selloff of tech shares, and is now trading at a price last seen in 2017. Meta shares dropped a further 14% in after-hours trading. Meta is battling a host of challenges, including the tough macroeconomic climate, growing competition from rival TikTok and the fallout from Apple Inc.'s ad-tracking changes, all of which have taken a toll on its massive advertising business. At least some of those issues are being felt across Silicon Valley, with Google's YouTube unit posting a decline in advertising revenue on Tuesday and Snap Inc. delivering disappointing results last week. But Meta is also undergoing an ambitious and expensive pivot, away from its core social-media products including Facebook and Instagram, and toward a future centered around the so-called metaverse where users can live, work and play in an immersive online experience. Meta's Reality Labs unit, which is driving the company's virtual-reality and metaverse efforts, posted revenue of $285 million for the quarter, a decline of nearly 49% compared with a year ago. The unit had an operating loss of $3.7 billion, and the company said it expects that figure will grow significantly next year. Horizon Worlds, Meta's flagship metaverse product for consumers, has fewer than 200,000 monthly active users, far less than the company's original goal of 500,000 users by the end of this year, according to company documents cited by The Wall Street Journal earlier this month. The company didn't provide new user figures for Horizon Worlds on Wednesday. Meta said its average ad price decreased 18% year-over-year, a decline almost certainly attributable to Apple's changes that make it harder for Meta to track users and serve them personalized advertising. In the same quarter last year, the average price per ad climbed 22%. ""While we face near-term challenges on revenue, the fundamentals are there for a return to stronger revenue growth,"" said Meta founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg. The company said it was also hurt by the strong dollar and that if foreign-exchange rates had been constant, it would have posted a slight increase in revenue. Meta reported a net profit of $4.4 billion for the third quarter. That represents the fourth quarter in a row that the company's bottom line has fallen, something Meta hasn't experienced in a decade. Investors are looking for any signs that Meta has begun to minimize the impact on its business of ad-tracking changes introduced by Apple last year. Meta warned in February that those changes would cost the company some $10 billion in 2022. For the quarter, advertising came in at $27.2 billion, down nearly 4% year-over-year. Analysts predicted Meta's advertising revenue would fall to $26.9 billion. Advertising revenue represented 98.2% of the company's total revenue. The company said it plans to invest in head count growth ""only in our highest priorities"" and shrink some of its teams. It said it had more than 87,000 employees at the end of September, a 28% increase over the same period last year, and anticipates staying around that level. Meta said it expects its 2022 total expenses to be in the range of $85 billion to $87 billion, down from a previous forecast of between $85 billion and $88 billion. The company said it estimates its 2023 total expenses to be between $96 billion and $101 billion. Meta is also grappling with a digital advertising market in upheaval from surging inflation and other factors, including the war in Ukraine, that are causing a slowdown in ad spending. ""It's tough a time to be a big social-media company right now,"" said Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence. ""You're facing a lot of pressures on revenue, usage and the worsening economy on top of it."" Before Wednesday, Meta shares had fallen nearly 60% and the company had lost more than $550 billion in market value in 2022. In its efforts to combat TikTok, Meta has given priority to the development and growth of Reels, its short-form video format on Facebook and Instagram. One area where Meta showed promise was in adding to Facebook's massive user base, which came in at 1.98 billion daily active users. That was up from 1.97 billion three months ago.

Meta_Facebook,"Facebook probably has your phone number, even if you never shared it. Now it has a secret tool to let you delete it.",31 October 2022,Business Insider,"1,432 words",0.9322,0.072,0.041,0.887,"English Copyright 2022. Insider Inc * Facebook almost certainly has your phone number and email address, even if you never handed them over. * That's because any friend who shared their address book with Facebook also shared your details. * Now the firm has a new tool to let people check if Facebook has that data, and delete it. Facebook's parent firm Meta has quietly rolled out a new service that lets people check whether the firm holds their contact information, such as their phone number or email address, and delete and block it. The tool has been available since May 2022, Insider understands, although Meta does not seem to have said anything publicly about it. A tipster pointed us to the tool, which is well-hidden and apparently only available via a link that is embedded 780 words into a fairly obscure page in Facebook's help section for non-users. The linked text gives no indication that it's sending you to a privacy tool, and simply reads: ""Click here if you have a question about the rights you may have."" Here's how the contact-blocking tool works Once you have actually found the contact-blocking tool, it's pretty straightforward. The company explains that even though you may not have signed up to use any core Meta service — such as the Facebook app, Messenger, or Instagram — it may still have your contact information. For many years, the firm asked users signing up for any of its apps to share their phone contacts, with the stated goal of helping them find friends. A side effect is that Meta, whose combined apps boast almost 3 billion daily users, has amassed an unknown but likely vast amount of personal contact information for people who have never signed up for an account, nor opted to share their information. The tool, in theory, allows a non-user to mitigate some of this damage. And although the tool is targeted at people who have never signed up for Meta's apps, it's likely also useful to anyone who is a user but never wanted to share this information. Enter any number or email you want to check The service asks whether you want to scan for a phone number, landline number, or email address that may have been uploaded by a friend who uses Meta's core apps: Facebook, Messenger, or Instagram. ""You can ask us to confirm whether we have your phone number or email address,"" the firm states. ""If we do, you can request that we delete it from our address book database. To prevent it from being uploaded to this database again through someone's address book, we need to keep a copy in our block list."" Meta declined to answer questions from Insider about how its block list works. You can enter any contact details you think may have been uploaded to Meta's services. It takes a few seconds to scan for that data and, if it shows up, Meta will ask if you want that contact information blocked. And here's what it looks like if Meta doesn't hold your data on its servers. The bad news: It's a drop in the ocean of what Meta has on you Figuring out the benefits of doing any of this requires a bit of intellectual reverse-engineering. A primary benefit is privacy and the knowledge your data won't contribute to the opaque power of Facebook algorithms, such as its infamous ""people you may know"" feature. It also gives more control to people whose data has been directly affected. Up until now, Meta only allowed users who had uploaded their contacts' data to delete that information. But in reality, privacy experts told Insider, deleting and blocking this small amount of data is one drop in the ocean compared to what else Meta has on you, regardless of whether or not you use its apps. For example, Meta harvests information on what people do outside its apps through Pixel, a piece of code that tracks what they do on different websites. That the firm has both browsing data and phone numbers of people who don't even use its services has given rise to the concept of ""shadow profiles."" ""We first heard about shadow profiles very early in Facebook's dominance,"" Heather Burns, author of the book ""Understanding Privacy"", told Insider. ""Facebook was keeping a sort of profile on you, even if you didn't have a Facebook account, composed of data gathered through things like Facebook Pixel. ""Parallel to that was this notion of uploading the contact book, which at various times in Facebook's history was enabled by default when you started an account,"" she added. ""Even if you were a privacy-conscious person, if you hit that button, you had uploaded your friend's data. It feeds into the shadow profiles of people whether or not they use the service at all."" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerbergappeared ignorant of the term ""shadow profiles"" during Congressional hearings in 2018, but admitted the firm collects data on non-users. Burns says she has never signed up for a Meta-owned service but found, on trying Meta's new privacy tool, that her email addresses and phone number had been picked up by the company. ""It's all in there, even though I've never had an account,"" she said. ""I don't believe anybody uploaded my data to Facebook in a malicious manner, I'm just in someone's address book."" But, she says, while it's positive that Meta now lets you block this information, ""that's just two strings of data."" ""I still have to use a browser with multiple defense plugins to protect myself from Meta on every page I view,"" she added. ""They are still tracking people, by default, even if they don't use an account. The notion that there's a tool to remove two data strings, to me, it's both beneficial and laughable."" Meta declined to answer questions from Insider about why it has rolled out this new tool, and why this year. Meta may use this tool as a regulatory defense Both Burns and Eerke Boiten, professor of cybersecurity at De Montfort University, speculated that the motivation could be political or legal as regulatory scrutiny of the major tech firms increases. ""There are two things — one is that installing the Messenger app leaks all of your contacts, that's an undeniable invasion of privacy,"" said professor Boiten. ""But now if anybody brings that up, Meta can always say: 'It doesn't have to be like that, you can undo the damage.'"" The second reason may be WhatsApp, which was bought by Meta in 2014 and whose core messaging functionality relies on people uploading their contact data to the app. An ongoing battle between Meta and regulators is whether it can connect the data it sucks up through WhatsApp to its other apps. ""Having the possibility to delist your number from Facebook in a way that it can't be used by Facebook to make friend suggestions would be an argument that 'OK, we can do this safely,'"" said Boiten. ""It wouldn't be very transparent ... the friend-suggestions algorithm is one of the least transparent of all, so it would be difficult to establish in any way that delisting a phone number would make an impact."" It's possible that Meta isn't really technically deleting your phone number and emails at all, said Boiten. ""The way Facebook has organically grown, it's probably true that the way they store information on people is on all sorts of disparate siloes,"" he said. ""It may well be that they only implement something like this on the outside — so at a point the phone number threatens to go outside the system, it says, 'This phone number is one we've been told we can't use,' rather than really removing information."" Although both Burns and Boiten welcomed Meta taking tentative pro-privacy steps, Burns described it as ""a classic American approach"" that involves scooping up data without asking, versus the more permission-based approach favored by European privacy regulators. ""To me, the Facebook tool is privacy labor,"" she added. ""They collected data they should not have collected in the first place, and are now shifting responsibility on you to remove it.""

Meta_Facebook,Can Mark Zuckerberg's Meta find its way back? -- Barron's,23 April 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"2,742 words",0.9791,0.09,0.06,0.851,"24 English , Inc. Slowing growth and competition from TikTok have sent its stock price tumbling. At the same time, the former Facebook is rolling the dice on the virtual world of the metaverse. Time for a reality check. BY Eric J. Savitz Meta Platforms, the former Facebook, has come under heavy fire from Congress, regulators, and even its own users, but there has been nothing like the crisis it now faces. Its core business is decelerating, and investors are questioning whether Meta can ever get back its money-minting mojo. The company's superpower -- its ability to precisely target ads on both Facebook and Instagram based on online consumer behavior -- has been badly disrupted. A decision by Apple (ticker: AAPL) last year to favor consumer privacy over ad targeting now makes it far harder to track iPhone user activity across the web. Facebook was ""sitting on this treasure trove of people's preferences,"" says Steven Tadelis, an economics professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. ""They know...where they are, their demographics, their age, friends, and education. And they knew you visited shoe websites, so now shoe ads are everywhere on your news feed."" Nearly one out of every four dollars spent on digital ads is on a Meta site. Only Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google is bigger. But Apple's changes, Meta (FB) has said, will mean that 2022 revenue will shrink by about $10 billion, or about 9% of 2021's revenue. Shares of Meta have tumbled 51%, to $188, since early September on worries over advertising. At the same time, Meta is facing a challenge from TikTok and placing an enormous bet on an immersive version of the internet known as the metaverse. Can CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg turn his social-media juggernaut around? Pressure will certainly grow this coming week when Meta reports first-quarter results, which are expected to underscore the challenges the company faces. Barron's spoke at length to top Meta executives who are helping spearhead the company's responses to the ad changes, the threat from TikTok, and the megabet on the metaverse. While the stock looks statistically cheap, addressing these issues will take time, the TikTok threat is considerable, and the payoff from the metaverse is many years away. The company may never be able to track users like it once did -- a critical component for its core advertising business -- and one of the senior executives acknowledged there is no easy fix. With Zuckerberg still holding well over 50% voting control of the company, there isn't likely to be any pressure from activist investors -- the changes needed at Meta will need to be self-propelled. The Ad Problem For almost a decade, Facebook provided investors with spectacular returns, driven by growth in the market for targeted online advertising. From its debut in the public market at $38 a share in May 2012, through its peak in September at $382, the stock appreciated 10 times, more than double the Nasdaq Composite's gain over the same span. Revenue expanded more than 3,000% from 2011 to 2021, reaching $118 billion last year -- almost all of that from targeted advertising. In contrast, Alphabet over the same period grew revenue 580%, and Apple, a relatively paltry 238%. Now, Meta's decadelong ad-growth story has stalled. The company's market cap, which peaked last year at $1.1 trillion, is down to $511 billion. Much of that reflects an astonishing $251 billion market cap lost the day after Meta reported fourth-quarter results -- the biggest one-day loss of value for a public company ever. The primary issue was Meta's outlook for the March quarter. It projected revenue of $27 billion to $29 billion, well shy of the previous Wall Street consensus forecast of $30 billion. When Meta reports this coming week, it will likely be its slowest-growth quarter ever. The soft outlook largely reflects fallout from Apple's adoption of ""app tracking transparency,"" or ATT, a policy that makes it harder for Facebook and other ad sellers to target ads based on what people are doing on other iPhone apps and websites. Apple has defanged a feature on its platform known as IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers), which assigned a unique designation for every device, making it easier to track visits to various apps and websites. With the adoption of ATT, apps running on iPhones now must ask users for permission to be tracked. Most people say no. Apple's move significantly complicates both ad targeting and ""attribution,"" the ability to connect consumer exposure to ads with later purchases. The issue Meta and its customers face is that delivering targeted ads boils down to understanding consumer intent. When you type ""HOKA running shoes"" into the search box on Google or Amazon, you've made your intentions clear. Facebook's ad mission is more complex: Encourage purchases by intuiting what you might be nudged into buying. Maybe you downloaded a running app, or searched for information on marathons. Ergo, HOKA ads in your news feed. Apple's privacy crusade is making it far more difficult for Meta to precisely target potential customers that way. What can Meta do now? The solutions to the ad-targeting issue will be complex, require a joint response from the broader advertising community, and will take time to develop, says Dennis Buchheim, vice president of advertising ecosystem at Meta. Going forward, he says, the company will rely on a combination of a more limited set of ""consented data"" -- people who opt in to tracking -- along with ""first party"" data from ad buyers and aggregated, anonymized, de-identified data, based on ZIP Code or other characteristics. Buchheim says the long-term solution will require collaboration with other industry players, and is likely to be iterative. ""There won't be an 'Aha!' moment when everything is solved,"" he says. Meta isn't the only company affected by Apple's privacy changes, but it has the most to lose, and it is taking the biggest hit. Ad tech firm Lotame estimates the combined impact of Apple's privacy changes to targeted ad revenue in 2022 will be close to $16 billion -- including a $12.8 billion hit to Meta (which is more than the company has projected) -- with smaller impacts on Snap (SNAP), Twitter (TWTR), and Google's YouTube. Apple's policy change, says Berkeley professor Tadelis, who has worked for both Amazon.com (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY), ""is a big blow"" to Meta's ability to target. ""The question is whether they can find workarounds,"" he says. ""It's unclear to me."" The consensus on Wall Street is that Meta's ad-targeting problem for now is getting worse, with many advertisers shifting at least a portion of their ad budgets to other platforms that don't rely on third-party tracking data, including Google and Amazon. Compounding the problem, Google has announced plans to take similar privacy measures on Android phones -- and next year, Google will start phasing out third-party cookies on its Chrome web browser, removing another valuable signal for ad targeting. RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson wrote in a recent research note that checks with ad agencies convince him that Meta will report ""another rocky quarter,"" with some small-business ad dollars shifting to Google, LinkedIn, and social-media ""influencers,"" as well as TikTok. The TikTok Challenge TikTok poses a serious threat to Meta. The wildly popular short-video app, owned by China-based ByteDance, has attracted a huge and growing audience. Zuckerberg called out the TikTok threat repeatedly on Meta's latest earnings call. Meta has a TikTok clone called Reels, which made its debut on Instagram in 2020 and Facebook in 2021. Clicking on the Reels link on either app brings up a series of short, vertically oriented videos that you can casually flick through, exactly like TikTok. It's a nearly precise copy. Tessa Lyons-Laing, Instagram's director of product, says the focus on Reels reflects a growing consumer interest in short-form video, rather than a specific response to TikTok -- but there is no question that in TikTok, Meta faces a formidable foe in the battle for consumer attention. Lyons-Laing points out that Meta has a long history of making major transitions in its business, shifting from desktops to mobile just over 10 years ago and launching Facebook Stories in 2017 to compete with Snapchat in ephemeral content. But TikTok is a beast. With more than one billion users, it is the toughest competitor Facebook has ever faced -- and it is on fire. The research firm eMarketer projects that TikTok's ad business this year will reach $11.64 billion, up 200% from $3.88 billion last year -- and about equal to Wall Street estimates for 2022 revenue for Twitter and Snap combined. The firm estimates that by 2024, TikTok's ad revenue will reach $23.6 billion, nearing parity with YouTube. ""Advertisers want to reach a passionate, dedicated audience, and TikTok can deliver that,"" says Insider Intelligence principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson. Reels is by far the fastest-growing portion of Meta's platforms. Morgan Stanley estimates that the feature will account for 15% of time spent on Facebook and Instagram by the 2023 fourth quarter, up from 6% recently. But the company needs to pick up the pace on monetizing Reels, which by Meta's own admission generates less revenue per unit of time spent than the news feed and stories elements of Facebook and Instagram. BofA Securities analyst Justin Post estimates that the shift of consumer time on the platform to Reels could be a $2.5 billion headwind to Meta's results this year, although he thinks that could shift to a tailwind by 2024 as monetization improves. Loop Capital Markets analyst Alan Gould, who pulled his Buy rating on Meta shares in February, is more skeptical. He contends that the economics of creator-driven content ""will not compare"" to the higher margins from user-generated content. 22 Apr 2022 Can Mark Zuckerberg's Meta find its way back? -- -2- ""The shift to short video is a move away from the largest and most durable competitive moat for Facebook,"" he wrote in a research note. The Bet on the Metaverse Can hope be found in the metaverse? That part of the business, formally called Reality Labs, had $2.3 billion in revenue in 2021, most of that from Oculus virtual-reality headsets. The unit accounted for less than 2% of Meta's overall revenue, with the rest coming from the core business. Reality Labs lost $10.2 billion last year, boosting its red ink over the past three years to more than $21 billion. Zuckerberg expects Meta to spend more than $10 billion on the project this year, with accelerated spending in the years ahead. Aside from Oculus headsets, the potential payoff is far in the future -- Zuckerberg has said it might take 15 years to realize his vision. Just how big the opportunity might be is anyone's guess. In an interview, Vishal Shah, Meta's vice president of metaverse, pointed to Zuckerberg's previous comments that the company expects more than one billion people to be spending time in the metaverse by 2030, together driving hundreds of billions of dollars of transactions in virtual goods. ""If you're in the metaverse every day, then you'll need digital clothes and digital tools,"" Zuckerberg said on the company's third-quarter earnings conference call in October. At the recent South by Southwest conference, Zuckerberg said the metaverse could help create ""many millions of jobs"" for creators of virtual goods. Finding a clean definition of the metaverse turns out to be harder than you'd think. In a recent interview with the podcaster Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg defined the idea as a ""feeling of presence...the feeling that you're right there in an experience and that you're there with other people or in another place. That's just different from all of the other screens that we have."" Shah echoes that idea: ""The core concept of the metaverse is where you feel like you are in an experience."" No doubt, big brands are intrigued about the potential. Nicola Mendelsohn, vice president of Meta's Global Business Group, says that among the large advertisers she speaks with, ""everybody wants to create a metavision strategy."" She points to recent virtual-reality experiences created by brands like Ray-Ban, Sephora, and Walmart (WMT) as the kind of early experiments now under way. ""You can do things that you couldn't do in the physical world,"" Mendelsohn says. ""People want shopping to be fun. On the web, shopping has become quite functional. It lost its serendipity."" Forrester Research cautions that however you want to define the metaverse, no one has experienced it yet. ""Despite the hype, there is no metaverse today,"" the research firm wrote in a March report, noting that it is still ""years away."" That isn't deterring Zuckerberg. He thinks Meta can jump-start the emergence of a large creator economy servicing the metaverse, eventually generating huge revenue for the company in the process. Meta recently stirred up the creator community when it revealed plans to take a 30% fee for goods sold in the Meta Quest Store, plus another 25% of the remainder for goods used on the company's Horizon Worlds virtual-reality platform. Therefore, as the company says, if someone sells a digital shirt for $1, the creator would keep only 52.5 cents. Meta also sees advertising dollars eventually flowing from the metaverse. Meta's Shah says that once there are thousands of virtual shirts to choose from, consumers are going to need ways to sort through the options -- and creators will want a method for getting attention. ""As people start to value how they show up, and what they own in digital spaces, at some point the things that you own in those spaces are equal or even of greater value to you than some of those things you own in the physical world,"" Shah says. Eventually, he says, advertisers will want search-based advertising to get their wares discovered. Meta won't put a number on how big the metaverse can be, and other estimates vary wildly. Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan took a stab at sizing the market in a report late last year. He used a United Nations estimate on the size of the global digital economy -- about $15 trillion in 2021 -- and guessed 15% to 33% of that could move to the metaverse, with market expansion driven by new experiences of 2.5% to 25% (another rough guess). The resulting range: between $2.6 trillion and $12.5 trillion. He gives no time frame for that estimate. Shares of Meta are historically cheap. But they will remain cheap until investors gain confidence that the company can fix the ad-targeting issue, compete effectively against TikTok, and figure out the metaverse, all while fending off critics who still think the company is far too powerful. Meta faces an array of pending lawsuits, including separate antitrust cases filed by the Federal Trade Commission and a group of 48 state attorneys general. Zuckerberg, meanwhile, has been spending time finding other ways to tell Meta's increasingly complicated story. He recently spent more than 90 minutes with the podcaster Tim Ferriss, discussing his adventures in competitive fencing, his struggles to learn Mandarin, and his family's weekly Shabbat dinners, among other things. He also made the odd assertion that there is value in people not quite understanding what the company is trying to do. ""If I'm doing something that feels too well understood for too long, then I feel like I'm just being complacent,"" he told Ferriss. ""At this point, I kind of feel like, if people fully feel like they understand what we are as a company and what we're doing, then I'm not pushing it hard enough...let's constantly be doing something that can be doubted."" On that score, at least, mission accomplished.

Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. posted its first decline in revenue and issued a muted outlook as the company struggles to adjust to macroeconomic forces and growing competition from rival TikTok. The company reported quarterly revenue of $28.8 billion, down almost 1% from a year earlier and slightly below the $28.9 billion Wall Street was expecting. It marks the first time that the company has posted a quarterly drop in revenue from the year earlier. ""We seem to have entered an economic downturn that will have a broad impact on the digital advertising business,"" Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday. ""It's always hard to predict how deep or how long these cycles will be, but I'd say that the situation seems worse than it did a quarter ago,"" he said on an earnings call. Meta is grappling with a digital advertising market in upheaval from soaring inflation and other factors that are causing a slowdown in ad spending. Google parent Alphabet Inc. on Tuesday reported the slowest rate of growth since the second quarter of 2020, when the pandemic crimped demand for advertising in some areas. Rival Snap Inc. reported its weakest-ever quarterly sales growth last week while Twitter reported a decline in revenue. Meta also disclosed that Facebook's daily active user base rose to 1.97 billion users. The figure was 1.96 billion three months ago. The increase defied expectations of analysts surveyed by FactSet who thought user numbers would fall. The company posted a net profit of $6.7 billion for the second quarter, the third quarter in a row Meta's bottom line has fallen. The company hasn't experienced such a slump since the fourth quarter of 2012. The weak advertising demand was reflected in Meta's average price per ad, which fell 14% in the quarter. A year ago, the company reported an increase of 47%, year over year, for its average price per ad. Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said in a statement that the company, like others, is feeling the pinch from the strong dollar, which is weighing on the top line. Meta's shares have retreated since the company posted quarterly results in February that showed a sharper-than-expected decline in profit, gloomy revenue outlook and dip in daily users. Meta's stock closed more than 6% higher and fell more than 4% after hours following the results. The company also said it expects its total expenses for 2022 to be between $85 billion and $88 billion, down from the company's previous outlook of $87 billion to $92 billion. The company attributed the lowered forecast to a reduction in hiring and overall expense-growth plans for the year. Mr. Zuckerberg reiterated that the company plans to slow the pace of long-term investments and steadily reduce head-count growth over the next year. ""This is a period that demands more intensity,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said. ""And I expect us to get more done with fewer resources."" Meta is going through a period of transition. Mr. Zuckerberg in April said the company would change how users would see content, in a bid to boost engagement. The company would use artificial intelligence to recommend content to Facebook and Instagram users from around those social networks, rather than solely showing users content from accounts they already follow. This effort mimics one of the signature features of rival TikTok, which Mr. Zuckerberg in February said posed stiff competition for Meta. Nearly one in six posts shown on Facebook and Instagram feeds are now coming from accounts that users don't follow and are based on artificial intelligence recommendations, according to stats shared by Mr. Zuckerberg. That could rise to nearly one in every three posts shown to users coming from accounts they don't follow by the end of 2023. During the quarter, Meta saw a 30% increase in the time that users are engaging with Reels, the company's answer to TikTok short-form videos, Mr. Zuckerberg said Wednesday. Meta, however, doesn't yet monetize Reels at the levels of some of its other features. ""In the near term, the faster that Reels grows, the more revenue that actually displaces from higher monetizing surfaces,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said. ""In theory, we could mitigate the short-term headwind by pushing less hard on growing Reels. But that would be worse for our products and business longer term."" Earlier this year, Meta said it planned to slow the pace of some of its long-term investments and adjust hiring plans. In May, the company disclosed a sharp slowdown in hiring, and in June, the company's head of engineering told his managers in an internal memo to identify and report low performers so they could force those employees out. The company on Tuesday also said it planned to raise the price of its Quest 2 virtual-reality headset by nearly 34% to $399.99, citing a rise in the costs to make and ship the products. The company's Reality Labs division, which includes VR hardware, posted revenue of $452 million. Analysts expected it to generate $431 million in quarterly sales. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday said it is seeking to block Meta from acquiring Within Unlimited Inc. and its virtual-reality dedicated fitness app, Supernatural. The deal, the FTC alleges, would lessen competition in the market and violate antitrust laws. Meta rejected the FTC's position and said the purchase would be good for the development of the virtual-reality market. The company also announced that come November, Mr. Wehner will transition into chief strategy officer, a new role at the company. Succeeding him as CFO will be Susan Li, Meta's current vice president of finance. Mr. Wehner has served as Meta's CFO since June 2014. (END) Dow Jones Newswires July 27, 2022 (21:54 GMT)"
Meta_Facebook,Meta’s Revenue Drop Is Expected to Accelerate,26 October 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,704 words,0.9571,0.083,0.049,0.868,"English , Inc. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is expected to show continued struggles to push through challenging business conditions that have combined to shave more than half a trillion dollars from its market value so far this year. Because of the tough macroeconomic climate, growing competition from rival TikTok and the fallout from Apple Inc.’s ad-tracking changes, analysts predict Meta will post its second revenue decline in a row when its earnings are released after markets close Wednesday. The company is expected to report quarterly revenue of $27.5 billion, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. That figure would be down more than 5% compared with a year earlier, after posting a 1% decrease last quarter. Meta’s Reality Labs unit, which is central to the company’s ambitious plans to build out the metaverse, is expected to show a revenue decline rather than growth. The division, which produces virtual-reality hardware among other things, is expected to post revenue of $426 million for the quarter, according to FactSet, which would be a decline of 23.7% compared with a year earlier. Analysts predict Meta will post a net profit of $5.2 billion for the third quarter. That would represent the fourth quarter in a row that the company’s bottom line has fallen, something Meta hasn’t experienced since the fourth quarter of 2012. Investors will be looking for any signs that Meta has begun to minimize the impact on its business of ad-tracking changes introduced by Apple last year. Meta warned in February that those changes would cost the company some $10 billion in 2022. For the quarter, advertising is expected to represent 97.8% of Meta’s revenue, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. Analysts predict Meta’s ad revenue will fall to $26.9 billion, down nearly 5% compared with a year prior. Meta is also grappling with a digital-advertising market in upheaval from surging inflation and other factors, including the war in Ukraine, which are causing a slowdown in ad spending. “It’s a tough time to be a big social-media company right now,” said Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence. “You’re facing a lot of pressures on revenue, usage and the worsening economy on top of it.” Fellow digital-ad giant Google on Tuesday reported its fifth consecutive quarter of slowing sales growth, with its core YouTube and search properties showing surprising weakness. Snap Inc. reported last week its weakest-ever quarterly sales growth and warned investors that it was operating on an assumption of no revenue growth this quarter from the year-ago period. Before Wednesday, Meta’s shares had fallen nearly 60% and it had lost more than $550 billion in market value in 2022. In its efforts to combat TikTok, Meta has given priority to the development and growth of Reels, its short-form video format on Facebook and Instagram. Meta has also been focused on its building of the metaverse, and earlier this month, the company unveiled the $1,500 Meta Quest Pro, its most advanced virtual-reality headset to date. Internal company documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal indicate that both efforts are off to rough starts. Instagram users are cumulatively spending 17.6 million hours a day watching Reels, less than one-tenth of the 197.8 million hours TikTok users spend each day on that platform, according to one of the documents. Meanwhile, Horizon Worlds, Meta’s flagship metaverse product for consumers, has fewer than 200,000 monthly active users, less than the company’s original goal of 500,000 users by the end of this year, a goal that has been revised to 280,000, according to company documents. One area in which Meta might be able to display promise is in Facebook’s user base. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect that the company might disclose that Facebook’s daily active user base has continued growing and has increased to 1.98 billion users, up from 1.97 billion three months ago.

Meta_Facebook,Facebook Parent Meta Sees Executive Exodus in India,16 November 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,570 words,-0.9659,0.042,0.068,0.89,"English , Inc. Three of Meta Platforms Inc.’s top executives in India have departed the company in recent weeks, with the Facebook parent changing the country’s reporting structure amid its first broad global restructuring, according to people familiar with the matter. The India head of Meta’s WhatsApp messaging service, Abhijit Bose, and Meta’s India public policy director, Rajiv Aggarwal, have resigned, a Meta spokeswoman said Wednesday. Their exits follow the departure announced earlier this month of Meta’s India head, Ajit Mohan. The departures of Messrs. Bose and Aggarwal are unrelated to layoffs of more than 11,000 workers Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg announced last week, the spokeswoman said. The company’s India head for years has reported directly to the core leadership team of Mr. Zuckerberg in Menlo Park, Calif., but will now report to Meta’s top Asia-Pacific executive in Singapore, the people said. Meta’s spokeswoman declined to comment on the structural changes. Meta’s services in India, its biggest market by users, have grown rapidly in recent years. Hundreds of millions of people have gotten online for the first time, and Meta has invested billions of dollars in the country. Its challenges, including government regulation and criticism by human-rights groups over its policing of hate speech, have also grown. Mr. Mohan, who had been India head since 2019, said in a post on LinkedIn that he had resigned from Meta to take on a role leading the Asia-Pacific region for Snapchat parent Snap Inc. A Meta spokesperson said Mr. Mohan’s move was also unrelated to Meta’s layoffs, and that Manish Chopra, Meta’s director of partnerships in India, is now Meta India’s interim head. Messrs. Bose and Aggarwal couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. Mr. Bose on LinkedIn said he planned to take a break before beginning a new entrepreneurial venture. Will Cathcart, head of WhatsApp, thanked Mr. Bose for his “tremendous contributions” to the service. Mr. Chopra said in a statement that Mr. Aggarwal had played an important role in the company. Meta has faced criticism from rights groups and been questioned by authorities over the presence of hate speech on its platforms in the South Asian nation, where it has more than 300 million people on Facebook and more than 400 million on WhatsApp. Meta has said it invests significantly in technology to find hate speech across languages in India. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2020 that Facebook’s then public-policy executive in India opposed applying Facebook’s hate-speech rules to a Hindu nationalist politician, along with at least three other Hindu nationalist individuals and groups flagged internally for promoting or participating in violence, according to current and former employees. The executive later departed the company. Meta and other tech firms are also facing tighter restrictions from New Delhi, which is establishing new guidelines to counter problematic online content and is working on new rules to protect users’ privacy. India’s antitrust regulator, the Competition Commission of India, is also investigating WhatsApp’s privacy policy, which was released last year. Meta said in 2020 it was paying $5.7 billion for a stake in Indian telecom operator Jio Platforms Ltd., its largest overseas investment. (END) Dow Jones Newswires November 16, 2022 (11:20 GMT)"

As included in the Information * Click here to view this its original format Social Media News: The 5 Biggest Stories of the Week We get it! You're busy scheduling content and engaging with your followers, so it can be difficult to make time to sit down and read about the latest Facebook algorithm update or how brands are leveraging TikTok. But, hey, it's also important to carve out time to learn about new ways to improve your social media strategy. So, put down your phone (we know: it's a big ask!) and indulge in reading about recent social media updates. Top Social Media and PR News Stories This Week If you work in social media marketing, these are the stories you need to read this week! * YouTube Moves to Monetize Shorts * LinkedIn Adds a ""Focused Inbox"" * New Features in Snapchat and Expanded 'Snapchat for Web' Usage * Community Chats Added to Meta YouTube Moves to Monetize Shorts YouTube is making waves this week with a move that many are eying closely for its potentially game-changing approach to monetizing short-form content - and that could be a major blow to TikTok. As revealed in a story from the New York Times, it appears that YouTube plans to incorporate ads into Shorts, allowing creators to monetize their short-form content. This move also opens monetization opportunities to a wider group of YouTubers, including those with fewer than 1,000 subscribers and less than 4,000 hours of watch time (the current thresholds needed to qualify for monetization on normal YouTube videos). LinkedIn Adds a ""Focused Inbox"" LinkedIn is introducing a new type of inbox to help users organize their incoming messages. This inbox separates messages into a ""Focused Inbox"" for your most relevant messages and an ""Other"" inbox, which essentially acts as a spam folder. It's unclear how LinkedIn is prioritizing or recognizing relevant messages to filter, however the inbox is designed to adapt to your preferences. This also presents sales teams with an interesting challenge, as sponsored InMail and other types of outreach have the potential to shift directly to the Other inbox. New Features in Snapchat and Expanded 'Snapchat for Web' Usage Snapchat is continuing to add new and interesting features for its users. Most recently they've introduced lock screen widgets for easy ongoing conversations, chat shortcuts to help you sort messages and be reminded when you need to reply, and question stickers similar to Instagram Stories. They've also expanded usage of their web-based platform to all users, rather than exclusively those with Snapchat+, so now all users can take advantage of video and voice calling through desktop. Meta has added a community chat feature in Facebook Messenger, currently still in testing and available to a limited number of users. With Community Chats, users can form a Facebook Group and facilitate chat and audio conversations right within the Messenger app. This feature creates an interesting new channel for Group admins and members to reach people and drive topic discussions. Update from September 13th Instagram Testing Repost Feature Instagram is testing a repost feature, which could be a game-changer for how people use the app, and interact with other users. Some users have begun to see the option to reshare posts directly to their feeds, similar to posting a retweet or sharing a post to your Stories. Currently reposting is available on Instagram, through third-party apps only - so making this an in-app feature could go a long way to shaping the evolving Instagram culture. Twitter Sharing Via WhatsApp and LinkedIn Twitter users in India will now see WhatsApp as the default option to share Tweets. The app has also released the option to share Tweets directly to Snapchat and LinkedIn, which will allow Twitter to better understand the metrics behind its users sharing habits. YouTube Introduces Ad-Free Videos for Educational Content More and more, people are using YouTube as an educational tool, both in traditional classroom settings as well as individually. Given the popularity of educational content, the video platform is introducing a few key features to make the user experience even better. These include an embedded YouTube player without ads or external links, which will be useful for teachers, paid courses from your favorite creators, and quizzes to help retain what you've learned. Snapchat Offers Election Resources As the US midterm elections rapidly approach, Snapchat is working to provide its users with election resources. They've launched a ""Voting 101"" hub which will allow new voters to easily register in-app, and learn about the voting process with tips and video tutorials. They can also access reliable and credible information about the broader election. Update from September 6th Instagram Testing Customization Features Frustrated Instagram users are getting some good news. Meta is testing two content control features for suggested posts. One is a Not Interested option on the Explore page that lets users hide posts and prevent others like them from showing up in the future. Similarly, the other is the option to hide suggested posts that include certain words, phrases, hashtags, and emojis in their captions. Available to selected users since May, Twitter Circle is now available to everyone! The feature lets users limit the visibility of some Tweets to a selected group of accounts. Every Twitter user gets one Circle that they can add up to 150 people to, whether the accounts follow each other or not. Like Instagram Close Friends, it's one more tool marketers and brands can use to offer exclusive, hype-building content for social audiences. Twitter's April Fools Day announcement has come true: The platform is testing the edit feature that users have been begging for for years. Edit Tweet allows users to make changes to Tweets for up to 30 minutes after they are published. Edited Tweets are marked by a blue pencil icon that, when clicked, shows viewers all of the previous versions of the Tweet. Currently limited to the Twitter team, this potentially game-changing feature will soon be available to Twitter Blue subscribers. Reddit Acquires AI Tech Firm for Ad Business Reddit is steadily expanding its advertising platform with its recent acquisition of Spiketrap, an audience contextualization company. Home to thousands of active, niche communities - many with unique jargon and insider references - Reddit aims to use Spiketrap's contextual analysis AI to improve ad targeting and performance. Update from August 30th NFT Display Expands on Meta Meta is offering new ways to display NFTs on Facebook and Instagram. Now users can connect their digital wallets and share their NFTs across both networks. Given the declining popularity of NFTs, this is an interesting thing for Meta to be focusing on, but it remains to be seen if NFTs will see an uptick in interest going forward. Snapchat Introduces Dual Camera Option The ability to shoot dual camera videos is now available on Snapchat! Like new rising social media platform BeReal, this functionality allows users to take Snaps using the front and self facing camera at the same time. Multiple formats are also available, from horizontal to vertical to different types of cutout frames. Twitter is doing everything it can to distract from the on-going legal battle with Elon Musk, including introducing some new features for professional accounts. Currently still in testing mode, some paid Twitter accounts are now seeing variable CTA labels for their bio, and more ways to manage product display and shopping. In another blow to organic SEOs, Google may soon start showing top Tweets as organic search results. When coupled with video results and featured snippets, this move would essentially push all other organic results well below the fold. It also presents some interesting implications for social copywriting, which now may need to consider SEO more than before. Update from August 23rd YouTube Expands CTV Advertising Options YouTube is expanding its ad options to accommodate for the increased CTV (Connected TV) usage. More and more people are watching YouTube on their TVs, which means that advertisers have a new platform to run more traditional TV-like ads at a lower cost. YouTube will now provide additional audience insights, and video campaign ""guarantees"" to marketers based on Nielsen data. New Shoppable Ads Coming to TikTok A new ad feature is coming to TikTok. TikTok's new shoppable ads come in three forms: video shopping, catalog listings, and live shopping. Each one will enable brands to better meet their consumers where they are in the buyer journey, helping to increase conversions and brand awareness. Currently, only approved brand partners will be able to access this feature. In continued effort to make the user experience more enjoyable and less toxic, Twitter appears to be developing a filtering feature for Tweet replies. While users can already choose who can reply to their Tweets, this adds a new layer of protection against potentially harmful or unhelpful comments. Users can opt out of seeing Tweets with offensive language (which doesn't mean others will also not see these replies - it's readers choice, rather than posters choice. Better Purchasing Experience Coming to Pinterest Pinterest is inching closer to a ""one-click"" purchase flow for consumers who buy products with Shopify merchants. Through their new ""hosted checkout"", when a user seeks to complete a purchase, they can make any necessary selections (size, color, etc) as step 1 in-app, and enter shipping and payment in step 2. This easier process is currently only available to US users and limited merchants quality - they must be part of Pinterest's verified merchant program. TikTok Tests ""Nearby"" Filter This could be a very interesting new feature for brands to use. TikTok is reportedly testing a new timeline filter that allows users to see posts from people who are nearby. This feature could be huge for location based marketing, such as restaurant openings, pop-ups, or other events. The test is not widely available yet, so we'll have to wait and see if it gets rolled out to a wider audience later this year. Update from August 16th In anticipation of the upcoming US midterm elections, Twitter is setting up safeguards to help prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation. These safeguards include the already-existing ""misleading"" tags that went into effect November of 2021, that prompt users to seek additional information, ""Prebunks"" which aim to pre-empt common disinformation with factual debunking. Their new feature is an Election Hub on the Explore page. The hub will include curated updates from Twitter's team and labels for various candidate profiles to make their positions clear. LinkedIn Introduces New Posting Templates In an interesting move, LinkedIn is now offering a template feature to encourage a variety of posting styles. Part of this update is to encourage the usage of LinkedIn's new link sticker, but it also seems to fall under the category of ""update for update's sake"". LinkedIn has always faced the unique challenge of balancing its roots as a professional networking site with the competitor landscape of other social media sites. This update has potential to make your LinkedIn feed feel particularly Facebook-like, which could end up hurting LinkedIn in the long run. New Family Center Available for Snapchat As reported earlier this year, Snapchat has been developing a Family Center, which is now active and available to all users! The center offers many resources for parents, who can now keep an eye on who their children are interacting with and the friends they add. Importantly, details of their teens' conversations will be kept private - parents will only see account names. Parents will need to sign up for a Snapchat account before being able to access the Family Center feature. More Features Added to Snapchat+ Also happening over at Snapchat are some new additions to their paid version, Snapchat+, which launched in June of this year. The paid version which includes benefits such as advanced analytics and pinned users, now has a few additional features. Priority Story Replies will boost your replies to Snap Stars, Post View Emojis will show up like a sign-off after your Snaps are viewed, exclusive Bitmoji backgrounds, and custom app icons. Update from August 9th Advertising Success Platform for Meta Now Available Meta is making it easier for companies to manage their advertising with a new advertising success center. Through this portal, advertisers can easily access tons of relevant resources and in-depth help articles for maximizing the success of their campaigns. This update comes just in time for the holiday season, giving marketers enough time to make sure they match up with competitors. LinkedIn Introduces a New Link Sticker LinkedIn is introducing a new link sticker, similar to what's available through Instagram Stories. This update could be huge for increasing engagement on posts and driving traffic. These new link opportunities could also be extremely helpful for influencers on the platform, as an additional promotional option. Twitter is introducing new business profile features to help encourage companies to invest more time (and money) on the platform. They've expanded their ""Location Spotlight"" feature to more countries, and now allow businesses to add a Google map. Twitter is also introducing a workshop series to help businesses make the most of all the features Twitter has to offer. Snapchat Continues to Elevate In-Stream Shopping Snapchat continues to stay on the cutting edge of AR with a new feature designed to make social shopping even more interactive. They are introducing shoppable AR stickers that users can use to essentially try on or add to your existing content before purchasing. Other users can also click on the products for more information. The update is not widely released yet, but could be a game-changer for the e-commerce industry. We'll be watching this one closely! Update from August 2nd In a sure to be unpopular move (price increases always are), Twitter announced this week that it will be raising the price of its subscription service ""Twitter Blue"". Currently this change goes into effect for new subscribers, but starting in October of this year it will also apply to those already subscribed. The price increase does not accompany any additional features. Pinterest Analytics Now Available on Mobile Now busy marketers on the go will be able to access Pinterest analytics in real-time from their mobile device. Although this update does not extend to filters like age and gender, nor will you be able to see monthly audience reports from mobile, it does give a more holistic view of how your pins are performing, allowing the option to course correct in a few clicks, while on a mobile device. Create Shorts From YouTube Videos This could be huge. YouTube is now making it easier to create a Short directly from a longer YouTube video. Creators can simply select a portion of their video (up to 60 seconds) and create a Short from your selection; all current Shorts editing capability remains if you choose to use this feature. Additionally, Shorts created from videos will link back to the full video, potentially driving even more traffic to your channel. Following in Facebook's footsteps…from several years ago…Twitter has introduced a live test of ""Status markers"" that can now be attached to a Tweet. Currently there are 17 options available, many of which could be useful, such as ""Thread"" and ""Spoiler Alert"". Although, given that users have already found their own ways to indicate these types of posts, it remains to be seen how quickly users will adopt this new feature. (So far the response has been less than favorable). Snapchat Introduces a New Music Creator Fund Musicians are often discovered on social media, and now Snapchat is making it even easier with a creator fund designed specifically for musicians. This special grant program, ""Sounds Fund"", is designed to ""recognize emerging, independent artists for the critical role they play in driving video creations, inspiring internet trends and defining cultural moments."" Musicians will now get paid based on how many plays their tracks have. Update from July 26th YouTube Integrates with Shopify Big news for brands and creators on YouTube! The video platform has announced a new integration with Shopify that will help eligible creators provide a more seamless shopping experience to their viewers. Currently this option is only available to channels with 1,000+ subscribers. Additional Captioning and Translation Options Coming to TikTok In effort to help creators reach wider audiences with their videos, and improve accessibility, TikTok is introducing more captioning tools and improved translation options. Users will now be able to turn auto-captions on and off, and several new languages have been added for translations. Additionally, stickers will now be translatable as well, helping users around the world gain better context from their favorite creators' videos. New Business Search Coming to Instagram A new map search feature is coming to Instagram. Now when users click on, or search for, a tagged location, they can view it on a map, learn more about the business, and see other nearby locations that may interest them - which they can also save to a list for convenient access later. The discoverability potential here is huge for businesses, and a great incentive for them to invest more time in Instagram as a marketing channel. Meta Introduces Music Rev-share Program This is a very interesting update that we'll be keeping a close eye on. Meta has announced a music rev-share program that will help creators access to many more music options. Owners of licensed music will take a portion of ad revenue received by the creator. All music uploads will still need to satisfy monetization policies. Currently this program is being released in the US, with a global rollout planned for later this year. Update from July 19th Reddit Integrates With GIPHY GIF responses are becoming very natural in everyday conversation, and Reddit is now making it easier to communicate this way in subreddits through a new integration with GIPHY. Currently this is an opt-in feature only and moderators have the ability to add it if appropriate. GIFs have been available in Reddit already, but to a smaller audience of paying users and via chat. This newest update will lend itself to a more fully integrated GIF language on the Reddit platform, which has been known to drive many memes and trends. TikTok Partners With NCSolutions More tools for businesses are now available on TikTok, through a new partnership with NCSolutions. Their machine learning tools give companies in-depth sales performance insights, and so when coupled with TikTok, brands will be able to assess how their campaigns are performing on a much more granular level. As demographics on TikTok evolve, this partnership could prove very fruitful for companies seeking to understand their audience analytics from a sales-specific perspective. Meta Adds a Paid Subscription Option Meta is adding a new way for users to help support their favorite content creators, through a subscription model. The set-up is similar to Patreon; in return for signing up, subscribers gain access to exclusive content and perks like ""subscriber chats"" allowing up to 30 people to join a private chat with a creator. Creators will also have the option to record subscriber-only Reels that will live in a new subscriber tab on Instagram. This update opens a lot of interesting doors when it comes to influencer campaigns and community building potential - we'll be keeping a close eye on how it evolves! As Twitter continues to battle it out with Elon Musk, that hasn't stopped the platform from continuing to roll out new features and updates. The latest is something Twitter has already teased and tested a bit this year: customizable and curated timelines. This feature would allow third parties to create a timeline around specific topics to encourage more relevant engagement. Users can follow timelines they find interesting, for easy access. From a user standpoint this would be extremely useful for decreasing mindless scrolling (thought this could have the unintended consequence of less time in-app) which Twitter may not actually want. Instagram Merges All Video into Reels Format In a bid to simplify their approach to video, Instagram has announced that, going forward, all videos uploaded to the platform will be Reels. It's not an all-together surprising move, though bound to cause some frustration among independent users, brands, and influencers who have depended on having a variety of video formats. Not to mention the fact that this impacts horizontally shot videos. Instagram is trying to level the playing field to make Reels more straightforward to shoot, with additional templates, camera options, and easier remixing features. Farewell Instagram Video…we'll be watching closely to see how this update plays out. Update from July 12th https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/cotweets A potentially big update could be coming soon to Twitter! The platform is currently in the early stages of testing a new styleofcollaborative Tweets, it's calling ""CoTweets."" This feature would allow two users to essentially co-author a single Tweet. Unlike when you simply @ someone in your Tweet, CoTweets require the approval of both participants, and make it easier for viewers to see more about the collaborators. Up to now Twitter has somewhat lagged behind when it comes to providing influencers with more ways to showcase brand collaborations, so this could be a great way for them to increase engagement and visibility. New API Provides More Product Display Options in Pinterest Pinterest is introducing a slew of new ways that retailers and influencers can promote shoppable products through API. Moving beyond single item product pins, or a carousel, now businesses can tag several products within one Pin. It's similar to an AR shopping experience (which Pinterest also has), allowing you to envision multiple items in one setting. The update also introduces video pins for catalogs, and a Shop tab on retailer profiles. More Analytics for YouTube Shorts Now Available YouTube continues to hone in on ways that creators can make YouTube shorts work for them. The latest update includes a more comprehensive analytics suite, which will serve to provide potential brand partners with more information as to the content creators reach and influence. YouTube is also now providing deeper audience analytics so creators can understand on a more granular level how their content resonates, and help them reach new viewers. No More Facebook Login Required for Meta VR Meta recently announced that people now have the option to log into an Oculus headset using either an Oculus account (until January 2023), Facebook, or a Meta Horizon account. On the surface this might seem like just a thinly veiled way to get more people signed up for Meta, but it also serves to further distinguish Meta from Facebook as two very separate entities. Eventually it appears that Oculus will require a Meta account but for now, if you've logged in previously with Facebook, you should be good. Instagram Creator Marketplace in Testing Instagram is working on a new Creator Marketplace to facilitate an easier, more intuitive, way for brands and collaborators to find people to work with. This would be a separate stand-alone site where people can search for influencers, as well as manage full campaigns from start to finish. Currently the site is in the early stages of testing and available by invite only. Update from July 5th You may soon be able to showcase your Snapchat Bitmoji as your Twitter profile pic. The functionality would also then connect your Twitter profile to your Snapchat profile. The integration is a new venture for the platforms, which haven't worked together previously, so it will be interesting to see how this functionality grows. Branded Likes Now Available on Twitter Twitter is rolling out a new feature for brands, allowing them to customize the ""like"" button for a 24 hour period. The gamification aspect could have a huge impact on engagement metrics. For those brands that can afford it, that is. The functionality is connected to a ""Timeline Takeover"" ad - an option that allows brands to pay for increased visibility on users' timelines. It's a great perk, but a costly one. YouTube is venturing into the world of ephemeral content with an experiment in disappearing comments for creators, within the Community tab. This feature would enable creators to post updates that disappear within 24 or 72 hours. It's an interesting addition that could lead to new kinds of engagement tactics for YouTube creators, such as merch discounts or giveaways. More Engagement Features Coming to Facebook Groups Facebook continues to tweak their Groups experience with more updates to facilitate conversation and improve user experience. Going forward users will now see a new sidebar on their Facebook home screen, from which they can access their groups. Convenient tabs under each group name will lead members straight to different areas of the group. There are also a number of new community management updates coming, including audio channels, and sub-topics where you can chat in real time with other members. Update from June 28th AR Features Are Coming to Instagram Stories As it often seems to do, Instagram is trying to keep up with its competitors by introducing similar features found on apps like TikTok. This time, it's Snapchat's turn, which has made great leaps into the AR world in recent years. Jumping on the bandwagon, Instagram will start to introduce AR features into Stories, which really haven't seen a major update in a while. The planned updates also jump on another bandwagon: NFTs. With AR stickers, Instagram users can now overlay a 2D, virtual NFT into their current physical environment. This functionality will apply to other AR stickers as well, but we'd expect to see Instagram pushing the NFT angle pretty hard. One to watch! Audio Rooms Pushed to the Forefront on Reddit As we've predicted, social audio has been a major marketing trend this year. But while audio features have been coming out, they've seen a slower uptake on the part of the users. Platforms are making various tweaks to try and highlight these features more, including Reddit which will start showcasing when an ""Audio Room"" is in progress, based on your interest selection. The nav bar looks very similar to Twitter's top nav when Spaces are in progress. They are also adding more hosting options for more users, hoping to encourage an upswing in Reddit Talks. Twitter has announced a new integration with Shopify, to make shopping from Twitter more streamlined for users, as well as merchants. Shopify retailers can now Tweet product listings that open a shoppable link when clicked. From Twitter: ""This partnership with Shopify is an important step in helping merchants unlock opportunities to reach shoppers on Twitter at those precise moments of discovery, inspiration, and consideration."" Twitter is giving users a much-anticipated way to write Tweets longer than 280 characters with ""Twitter Notes"" - a max of 2500 words to be exact. When expanded a Twitter note will open something that looks like a blog post, with a header image, header text, and unique URL. Remains to be seen how this new feature will impact the Twittersphere culture, but it's an exciting update to keep an eye on. Plus, Twitter notes can be edited. So perhaps, in lieu of our still-elusive Tweet edit button, people will begin using Notes as Tweets instead. More Creator Monetization Options Available Through Meta Creator monetization initiatives have really shot to the forefront this year, and Meta is keeping up, with several new options coming soon. On Reels, cross-posting and monetization on both Instagram and Facebook will be available soon. A new Creator Marketplace is making its way onto Instagram, to help facilitate more fruitful brand partnerships on the platform. Lastly, the ""Facebook Stars"" donation program will be expanded to Instagram Reels. These features are still in early testing, but with plans for wider rollouts very soon. Update from June 21st ""Funny"" Reaction Released on LinkedIn A first batch of users on LinkedIn will now see a laughing emoji as an option for reacting to posts. LinkedIn teased this update earlier this year, and it looks like they're moving forward with rolling it out. The laughing emoji will join LinkedIn's other 6 reactions, which arguably are more suited to the professional networking platform - this could be why LinkedIn hasn't released the more lighthearted laugh reaction until now. It may encourage a wider range of non-professional posts or cause some posts to appear less thought-provoking than intended, due to a larger majority thinking the post is ""funny"" as opposed to ""interesting."" Reddit Acquires ML Software Company, Spell Reddit recently announced their acquisition of machine learning platform Spell. This new addition will help Reddit ""improve speed and relevancy"" with integrated ML across the site. And so users may soon start to see more relevant results and suggestions based on past searches and browsing behaviors. New Ad Functions in Pinterest Brands on Pinterest now have the option to create ads from Idea Pins, which are similar to a TikTok video or Reel. The ads will include a Sponsored tag, and act like a boosted post to relevant audiences using interest targeting. They'll be full screen, with prominent site links where users can get more info or purchase products. Pinterest is also making it easier for creators to work with brands, and if they have an Idea Pin collaboration, targeting will amplify the ad to both audiences. Snapchat is Working on a Subscription Model Snapchat+ is coming. The app is currently working on a subscription model that would offer users additional benefits, including exclusive icons, a profile badge, and pinning a ""#1 friend"" (remind anyone of the Myspace Top 8?). The subscription would likely also include early access to new features Snapchat is working on. Instagram Introduces More Safeguards for Younger Users In response to growing concern around usage rates and how Instagram usage affects young people, particular teenage girls, Instagram has implemented new safeguards. Designed to minimize exposure to potentially harmful posts these measures include ""nudges"" which will push users toward different types of content than what they had been consuming. Like TikTok, Instagram has also introduced reminders to take a break from scrolling, and enhanced parental controls. Update from June 14th TikTok Encourages Breaks in Screen-Time Taking a page out of the Netflix book, TikTok has introduced a new way for users to be mindful about their screen-time. In TikTok settings, you can now set notifications to be reminded at 10, 15, or 20 minute intervals. These scheduled breaks are a great way to encourage less screen time and enforce healthier habits for improved mental wellbeing. The update also comes with a dashboard view that tells users how much time they are actually spending scrolling through videos. LinkedIn Unveils Business Center to Enhance B2B Efforts More tools are coming to LinkedIn for B2B companies using the networking platform for sales and marketing. The new Business Manager platform within LinkedIn offers a dashboard from which you can access support and manage your business pages, ad accounts, admins and more. The platform is essentially a lighter, free version of Sales Navigator, which offers more complex tools for businesses. You Can Now Boost LinkedIn Events Through Ads While it's surprising that this option didn't already exist, a new update from LinkedIn will allow you to boost your LinkedIn events to a wider audience. This is a small but significant change that could lead to greater event sign ups, increasing brand awareness and encouraging more people to follow you. The boost function for events is found on the event page and once you've set the boost parameters, LinkedIn will generate an ad for you. New Meta Micro-Site Helps LGBT Businesses In partnership with the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce, Meta has launched a new micro-site for Pride (and beyond), dedicated to providing resources for LGBT+ businesses. The site offers a range of services and tools, including certification training and funding options. Video features providing tips and suggestions are also available from established LGBT+ influencers and business owners. Update from June 7th * Sensitive Content Controls Expanded in Instagram * Feed Sorting Options Added to Twitter Communities * Shoppable Shorts Coming to YouTube * Pinned Posts Now Available on Instagram Sensitive Content Controls Expanded in Instagram https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/updates-to-the-sensitive-content-control https://twitter.com/InstagramComms/status/1533843794847625216 Instagram users will now be able to further manage what they see in the app with a new update that heavily expands sensitive content controls. Now you can tell Instagram which types of content you'd like to see more or less of, from several areas: Search, Reels, followed accounts, Hashtag Pages and In-Feed Recommendations. From a parental control perspective, this update will help to greatly reduce the changes that children will encounter inappropriate content as well. Twitter continues to improve Communities, likely in hopes that more users will start tapping into this Twitter feature more. Their newest update will allow users to control how they view the timeline - you can choose from a chronological view or ""For You"" which showcases the most relevant Tweets based on your past engagements. Shoppable Shorts Coming to YouTube YouTube's latest foray into making Shorts a key part of the platform also taps into a huge social trend this year: social commerce. Starting on June 16, their 2nd annual Beauty Festival will feature celebrities, brand partnerships, and exclusive product unveilings. The difference this year is that viewers will have the ability to shop the products in real time, directly within YouTube. Pinned Posts Now Available on Instagram Instagram was testing pinned posts back in April, and now this feature has been released globally. Users can now pin up to 3 specific posts to the top of their main profile, allowing for additional creative control over what visitors first see. Influencers and brands could use this space to showcase a top performing post, a longer bio, or answers to commonly asked questions. Update from May 31st You can now add a pinned Tweet to the top of a Community timeline. It functions in the same way as a normal pinned Tweet and will be a useful addition to Twitter Communities. It could be used as a prompt to spark discussion or a way to display important news and announcements. While Twitter Communities has been slow to take off, they're still in the relatively early stages, and this update could go a long way in bringing them out of the shadows. Shared Stories Introduced to Snapchat Iterating on their Custom Stories feature, Snapchat's new Shared Stories allows users to create a Story, tagging friends and family who can then contribute to the Story. It's a great way to facilitate community and connectedness within Snapchat groups - note that Shared Stories do not have a chat enabled meaning they are private to whoever's invited in the group. Like all Snaps, Shared Stories will disappear after 24 hours. TikTok Adds WooCommerce Integration TikTok recently announced a partnership with WooCommerce, which will be a huge asset for retailers large and small. The integration allows for more seamless posting of products from a WooCommerce dashboard. The integration follows a strong trend in eCommerce, that is encouraging in-app shopping and purchasing. Instagram Adds an Amber Alert Feature Instagram has incorporated an Amber Alert feature with the hope of spreading awareness and increasing the chances of finding missing children. The alerts will show up based on if you are located within a designated search area. If you are, Instagram will display images and other important information in a post on your home feed. You can then share these details to your network. Improved Mobile Connection for YouTube and TV YouTube is making it easier to actively participate when watching YouTube videos on your TV. You can now sync your YouTube app on your phone and TV, meaning you'll be able to like the video, subscribe, leave comments, participate in live streams, and find related videos while watching. Update from March 24th As we predicted earlier this year, creator monetization is proving to be a huge trend in 2022. This week it's Twitter's turn. The app recently rebranded their ""Twitter Media"" page as ""Twitter Create"" with a renewed focus on helping creators earn using Twitter's monetization tools. The micro-site includes several resources, such as blog articles and case studies to help creators improve their presence and promote their work. A small but noticeable change is coming to YouTube's desktop view. The platform plans to move video comments to the right side of the video, with only a top comment displayed underneath the video. Similar to the mobile view, when clicked, this comment will open all comments in the right sidebar. This will be helpful for those who enjoy scrolling the comments while watching videos, but such layout updates are rarely received favorably at first so it will be interesting to see the response from users. eBay Listings Come to Snapchat Snapchat has added a new e-commerce feature in partnership with eBay. Now users can share shoppable links to items they're selling, and show their friends what they're bidding on. From Snapchat: ""More than 142M buyers shop on eBay globally to find everything from the latest sneaker drops to rare, vintage handbags, and now, Snapchatters have a seamless way to share what they've been eyeing…right where conversations with real friends are already happening."" Snapchat to Introduce a Family Center Also happening over at Snapchat is a new Family Center. Screenshots shared by TechCrunch reveal more information about what parents can expect from the addition. Namely, they'll be able to see who their children follow and who they're engaging with. Given that Snapchat's main draw and functionality comes from the fact that messages are private and disappearing, it's likely this new feature won't be popular among younger users, but will help give parents peace of mind. Realistic Digital Avatars Coming to Meta It was only a matter of time before Meta worked to improve the appearance of their digital avatars. The current avatars are cartoony, and not as customizable as Meta wants - plus they're only designed down to the torso. A new video shared by Mark Zuckerberg reveals plans for more realistic avatars in the future. Here's hoping they don't venture too far into ""uncanny valley"" territory! Update from May 17th YouTube Shorts Expands Their Green Screen Option While YouTube already had an option to choose a green screen effect, this feature has been expanded so you can now select from other eligible YouTube videos to replace the green screen. Creators can choose to use just the audio from the video, the imagery, or both together. To access, users first need to save videos their watching as a green screen, which they can then select later when making a Short. TikTok Partners With Foursquare Advertisers will want to take note of this TikTok news! The app recently announced a new partnership with Foursquare, integrating with Foursquare Attribution - a product to help measure ""the effectiveness of advertising campaigns at driving people into stores"". Marketers will then be able to better strategize how to encourage foot traffic from their ads on TikTok. Twitter is working on ways to bring Spaces more to the forefront with an option to start a Space as a response to a Tweet. Tweet responses up to now have been limited to likes, quote Tweets and comments, so this could be a major leap forward when it comes to engagement on Twitter if it takes off. Also happening over at Twitter is a new policy to stop duplicate and spam Tweets. This has been a primary issue on the platform for many years, and it's good to see Twitter now trying to address it. Their updated guidelines will crack down on what's known as ""copypasta"" by limiting their visibility. Users can also report Tweets that they suspect are copypasta spam. Real-Time Captions Added for LinkedIn Lives Several new updates are in the works over at LinkedIn, including the addition of real-time captioning on LinkedIn Live broadcasts. The new feature is a great step forward for accessibility and will make it easier to participate for hearing impaired individuals. LinkedIn is also adding custom URLs from your profile. Currently this option is only available for profiles using Creator-Mode, but will likely be expanded to all profiles in the near future. Update from May 10th LinkedIn Algorithm Will Start De-valuing Polls If you've been relying on Polls for your LinkedIn to up those engagement numbers, you may want to start diversifying. Due to user feedback, LinkedIn has announced that its algorithm will begin de-valuing polls and other ""engagement-hacking"" posts that encourage users to respond with an emoji reaction. Instagram Ventures into NFTs The latest social platform to jump on the NFT bandwagon, Instagram is exploring various options for users to display NFTs on their profile. Users will be able to connect to their preferred wallet accounts (such as Rainbow or MetaMask) and images of verified NFTs in an Instagram grid will appear with a small tick mark. WhatsApp Continues to Improve Group Chats WhatsApp has been steadily improving their community features, particularly when it comes to group chat functionality. Their recent update now allows up to 512 people to join or be added to a group chat. Also increasing in size is the maximum file size users will be able to share, which is now 2GB. TikTok Introduces ""Pulse"" Program For Creator Monetization More and more platforms are adding features to entice and empower creators such as creator funds and additional monetization opportunities. This week TikTok joined the trend announcing their new ""Pulse"" program. Using Pulse, brands can choose from 12 TikTok categories (such as beauty or fashion) to facilitate more strategic ad placement. The program then has a rev-share component for creators, meaning that they don't need to have a specific relationship with the brand in order to gain monetary benefits from the ads that are shown next to their content. Update from May 3rd YouTube Tests Ads in Shorts YouTube is testing ad placements for their Shorts feature. Shorts have seen a big jump in viewership, which is now up to 30 billion daily views, according to Google. Given this rise in popularity YouTube is testing running advertising between clips. It's also working on ways to help creators monetize through Shorts. You could soon be able to add multiple media types to a single Tweet. Currently Twitter only allows still images or GIFs or videos to be posted at one time, they cannot be attached to the same Tweet. Twitter is currently testing the option to mix and match which could open some interesting doors for content promotion! Audio Hub is Leaving Facebook Less than a year after it was announced, Facebook is rolling back their audio hub. Introduced in June, 2021, the new audio features on Facebook, promised to help podcasters find new audiences and make it easier to tune in to podcasts from within the Facebook platform. Due to lackluster growth, and likely their new laser focus on the Metaverse, these audio features will be phased out by June, 2022. 90 Second Instagram Reels in Testing We should have seen this one coming. After TikTok's announcement that 10 minute videos would soon be available, it was only a matter of time before Instagram ventured into longer Reels. The update is still in testing, and has not yet been rolled out to all users, though it likely will be soon. Update from April 26th Undoubtedly the biggest news out of social media land this week is Elon Musk buying Twitter for $44 billion dollars. The news has been met with very mixed reactions, as people struggle to predict what the purchase means for the future of Twitter. If Musk's Tweets are any indication, the long elusive edit button, banning bots, and authenticating all users will be among the first promises to be fulfilled. More changes will certainly come, but what shape they'll take is still very much unknown. Pinned Posts on Instagram A big change on Instagram could be around the corner. The platform is currently testing pinned posts, which could be a huge asset for marketers and influencers alike. The update will allow users to pin posts to the top of their Instagram grid, giving more creative control and the ability to showcase various aspects of a brand such as a top performing post, about-us, or commonly asked questions. Music Clips Now an Option For Facebook Replies Responses and social media comments on a post are a key measure of that all-important metric: engagement. So social platforms have consistently tried to find ways to make them enticing. Meta is continuing the trend by introducing music responses. Now you can add context and color to your replies with an accompanying music track. It remains to be seen if this feature will get utilized with the same regulation as gifs or emojis, but for now it's an interesting addition worth watching…or listening to as the case may be. Templates Tested for Instagram Reels If you're someone who's struggled with creating Reels, you're not alone. The functionality has always been a bit clunky, even with several improvements made in recent months. So Instagram's new test providing templates for Reels would be a welcome feature for many social media managers out there. Templates allow you to recreate popular Reels trends and styles - each clip is automatically set at a specific length, helping with those crisp and punchy transitions, and perfectly timed audio cues. Reddit Launches a Creator Fund Major social platforms have introduced creator funds in the last year, and Reddit is the latest to follow suit. Their program has technically been live, in pilot mode, for six months, with 13 community-nominated projects already funded. Now it's been made official and Reddit is accepting submissions ""for projects, events, contests, giving, almost anything you can think of to bring people together for inspiration and delight."" Grants will be awarded for projects ""based on their creativity, feasibility, and community impact."" Update from April 19th Recent Hashtags in Instagram May be Going Away In a move that may puzzle a lot of users, Instagram is in the early stages of testing removing the ""Recent"" tab for hashtag searches. This means that only the ""Top"" posts or ""Reels"" will be available to view when you search for a particular hashtag. This approach is clearly another move on Instagram's part to increase engagement on Reels, but it would definitely create issues for new and small businesses and influencers trying to use branded hashtags, contest hashtags, or industry hashtags for brand awareness. Snapchat partners with LACMA for new AR Art Series Continuing to find new ways to incorporate AR, Snapchat recently partnered with LACMA (Los Angeles County Museum of Art) for a unique new art series, bringing cultural nuance and diversity to the forefront. Participants can use the Snapchat camera at various locations around Los Angeles to get a deeper experience of a particular art piece and its history . Snapchat is working with a number of renowned artists to bring these pieces to life through AR. Communities Feature Added to WhatsApp WhatsApp continues to improve their group texting experience with a new feature: ""WhatsApp Communities"". Now entities such as schools and local clubs can message several groups at once, making it easier to send updates and organize events. WhatsApp has also introduced several enhancements to group texting including emoji reactions, file sharing, and group calling for up to 32 participants. TikTok Introduces More Interactive Options for Ads Now brands will have the ability to capture even more engagement through their TikTok ads through ""Interactive add-ons"". From TikTok: ""Interactive Add-Ons capture the undivided attention of your audience in a full-screen, sound-on environment to boost brand engagement"". These additional elements are available as either ""Standard"" or ""Premium"". Standard add-ons are great for bottom funnel goals such as clicks and conversions while Premium add-ons are suggested for top of funnel goals like brand awareness. Update from April 12th Twitter posted an unassuming announcement on April Fools day, that they would be introducing an edit button, to a predictable onslaught of annoyed responses. Despite very persistent requests over the years, Twitter has been extremely reluctant to implement this functionality. But it appears the April Fools joke was not actually a joke at all, and Twitter is in fact finally working on an edit button. Details are still vague, but at least Twitter is acknowledging what its users have been asking for, practically from day 1. Instagram Removes In-stream Video Ads Soon in-stream video ads on Instagram will be a thing of the past. As it has hinted for months, Instagram is putting more and more focus on Reels and encouraging users and marketers to use them. Video ad placement options will still be available, for example during Instagram video posts (remember, videos can be up to 60 minutes), and in Stories. But marketers should definitely be thinking about adapting their ad strategy to favor Reels sooner rather than later. Pinterest Works to Remove Climate Change Misinformation In advance of Earth Day, Pinterest has enacted a new policy to crackdown on Pins that may contain misinformation around climate change. This policy applies to both ads and regular Pins and addresses the following: climate change denial, inaccurate or false information about climate change solutions, misrepresentation of scientific data, misleading content surrounding natural disasters. Enforcement of the policy will be interesting to watch as Pinterest is the first social platform to implement these kinds of strict guidelines regarding climate change information. Snapchat Launches Dynamic Stories Snapchatrecently launched ""Dynamic Stories"", which enables content partners to connect an RSS feed, facilitating more accurate and up-to-date reporting from news outlets and publications. From Snapchat: ""...these Stories update in real-time, meaning Snapchatters can keep up with the latest news as it breaks."" A few early partners already making use of the new feature include: Buzzfeed, CNN, The Wall Street Journal, and Vice. Update from April 5th Instagram Adds New Messaging Features DM'ing on Instagram has become an important part of the fabric of how users interact on the platform. And Instagram has taken notice, recently announcing some exciting new features to make messaging easier and allow for different media types. Now users will be able to reply to incoming DMs while scrolling, rather than having to navigate to their messages screen first. Additionally, messages now supports sharing music, as well as themes and polls for group chats. There are three new ad formats coming to Twitter : Interactive Text Ads, Product Explorer Ads, and Collection Ads. Interactive Text Ads will allow marketers to link to different landing pages through highlighted words (up to 3) within the ad. Product Explorer Ads showcase products in a 3D, interactive format. Lastly, Collection Ads feature a carousel of up to 5 products that users can browse, plus a hero image. These new options offer marketers lots of variety, though they also mean that regular users' Twitter feeds could soon look and feel very crowded with advertising. YouTube Plans a Move into Podcasts In a continuing bid to diversify and lean into the creator economy, YouTube appears to be making a move into the Podcast arena according to a leaked slide deck sent to PodcastNews.net. In addition to incorporating RSS feeds on the platform directly, creators will be able to monetize Podcasts, and access analytics to help them maximize listeners and engagement. More Tools Available to Creators on LinkedIn LinkedIn is continuing to make it easier for creators to get the most out of the professional networking platform. Creators now have access to more in depth analytics tools and improved options for adding video to a creator profile on LinkedIn - including video prompts to help visitors to their profile get to know more about them and the work they do. Snapchat Introduces YouTube Linking A small but significant update from Snapchat this week! You can now send people directly to a YouTube video from your Snaps with a link sticker, instead of needing the extra copy-paste step. From Snapchat: ""This is the first time that YouTube links can be shared visually to Snapchat Stories and one-on-one Snaps, while still accessing the Camera and full suite of Snapchat Creative Tools for self expression."" Update from March 19th Instagram Brings Back the Chronological Feed After a six-year pause, Instagram has brought back chronological feeds! Along with letting users see newer posts first on the new Following tab, the platform also rolled out a viewing option called Favorites that lets them choose which accounts to see new posts from. These new options were highly-anticipated, but they're easy to miss on the platform. The main feed is still curated by Instagram's algorithm. LinkedIn Pages Adds Newsletters For Businesses LinkedIn Pages, the website's option for businesses and organizations, now lets users publish their own articles and recurring newsletters directly on the platform. Previously this option had only been available to those using ""Creator Mode"" on LinkedIn. Now companies can also take advantage of this feature to grow their communities through the newsletter subscription model. Meta Combats 'Watchbait' Meta recently announced that it is cracking down on misleading videos popularly known as 'watchbait.' These videos may entice viewers to watch by withholding information or describing the content in a sensationalized or misleading manner. Meta will tag videos like this as potential 'watchbait', so video marketers should take care to avoid clickbaity titles, thumbnails, and video descriptions. Big news from Twitter this week! Professional Twitter accounts are now available to anyone who wants to create one. Previously Twitter's approval was required to switch to a Professional or Business account. With this change, a much wider group will be able to make the change, though certain qualifications still need to be met, including having a complete profile set up and no history of violating Twitter community guidelines. TikTok Adds GIF Library In the ever-expanding world of new features on our favorite platforms, TikTok has now added a GIF library users can access to enhance their TikTok videos. This library is in partnership with Giphy, one of the biggest GIF- search tools around, giving TikTok users a plethora of choice. From TikTok: the library will make it ""easy for people to start or participate in their own trends, using clips from their favorite shows, GIFs, memes and more by seamlessly integrating them into their TikTok videos."" Update from March 21st Pinterest Users Can Now Share Idea Pins Across Platforms Pinterest is helping pinners get wider exposure and reach with its latest sharing feature. The platform now lets content creators share Idea Pins - the platform's answer to TikToks and Instagram Reels - on their other social media pages. The Idea Pin Sharing option lets users add Idea Pins directly to Facebook or Instagram Stories. And with Idea Pin Downloading, they can download and upload their videos to TikTok, Snapchat, and other platforms. Meta Files Lawsuit Against Fake Reviews Provider Customer review platforms have always had trouble spotting and getting rid of fake customer feedback. A new court battle may change how they keep tabs on their websites and deal with users who break their rules. Recently, Meta filed a lawsuit against the operator of a business that allegedly ""provided fake reviews and feedback to businesses in order to artificially increase their Customer Feedback Score"" on Facebook. This marks a new level of the company's enforcement of its terms and policies. YouTube Launching New Livestreaming Features YouTube is making its livestream experience more dynamic with some new features set to roll out across 2022. Along with a split-screen mobile viewing option currently rolling out, in the next few months, the company will introduce a livestream Q&A feature. YouTube is also currently testing Go Live Together, which lets livestreamers co-host shows with a shareable link. TikTok Partners with the Cannes Film Festival TikTok recently announced its official partnership with Festival de Cannes. Though the film festival made waves when it banned selfies in 2018, it's now courting the younger, digital-first audiences that flock to TikTok. Select creators from the app will be on the red carpet scoring exclusive interviews, as well as capturing behind-the-scenes content backstage. Plus, the winners of the partnership's #TikTokShortFilm competition will receive their awards at the festival. Snapchat Adds Custom Landmarkers AR Feature Snapchat is steadily expanding its popular augmented reality experiences, also known as Lenses. Its newest feature is Custom Landmarkers, which lets creators make their own AR experiences tied to locations and landmarks in their communities. As a whole, Lenses continues to hold a lot of promise for creators and marketers alike. Earlier this year, Snapchat reported that 74% of AR Snapchatters used the feature for shopping. Update from March 17th Instagram Lives are an excellent way to encourage engagement, but when there's a high volume of questions and comments to keep up with, it can be difficult to also manage negative or potentially harmful comments that show up. For this reason, Instagram has now introduced an option to add a moderator to Instagram Lives. Moderators will have the power to remove users from the Live, turn off commenting, and report comments. In the latest move by a social platform to put the power in the hands of the creators, Instagram has launched a creator lab to help content creators maximize their Instagram success. The Creator Lab is separated into several different sections, providing tips and advice from well established Instagram influencers. Topics cover everything from understanding Instagram's algorithm to creating a content calendar. A time-based feed without algorithm influence? Yes please, say many social media users these days. Twitter has answered the call with a new option to choose a feed based on ""Latest Tweets."" You can access this chronological feed through the stars icon in the top right corner on both mobile and desktop. Meta, the parent company to Instagram and Oculus Quest, has introduced more parental controls for Instagram and VR users. Parents will now have a more detailed dashboard from which to manage what their children see, who they can interact with, as well as set up screen time limits. They will also be able to access additional resources to help them use these tools more effectively. In VR, linked accounts and app blocking abilities are now an option for concerned parents. Update from March 10th Remember when Facebook's old profile format got replaced with Timeline? It appears a similarly big change may be on the horizon for Facebook users in the near future. The new layout moves Facebook menu options to the left side of the screen and siphons the rest of the screen in the 3 sections. As others have noted, the layout seems a bit messy. Currently the change is only being seen by a small group, so we'll have to wait and see how this testing phase works out before we know more. A great update from Instagram this week regarding tagging! Now creators will be able to tag other creators and influencers in their photos or videos - with extra information about their contribution to the image. This will make it easier for users to find, connect with, and follow talented artists and creators, as well as facilitate better crediting when it comes to collaborative works. If you weren't aware of Twitter's new ""Birdwatch"" program, you soon may. The crowd-sourced fact checking system allows Twitter users to ""add context to Tweets that are seemingly misleading"". Twitter has been going through several rounds of testing and user feedback for the program and are now releasing it to a small, randomized, sub-group. In order for Tweet notes to be visible, enough ""Birdwatchers"" need to rate the notes as helpful, but you will likely start seeing them more and more in the coming months. LinkedIn's ""Career Break"" feature, released earlier in 2021, has now been launched to all users. This useful option allows LinkedIn users to indicate a gap in their work history, with details explaining why and for how long they had a career break. Especially useful for Covid-times, LinkedIn says this has been one of their most requested features. We have two big updates from Twitter this week. In addition to expanding their Birdwatch program, Twitter has also started testing their version of social shopping: ""Twitter Shops"". With this feature ""merchants can handpick a collection of up to 50 products to showcase to shoppers on Twitter."" Users will be able to browse products and prices, and if they wish to purchase they can do so through a link to the merchants website. Update from March 1st Taking Vine's downfall as a cautionary tale, TikTok has announced that 10 minute videos will soon be available. This move will give creators more space for ads and monetization and provide more flexibility when it comes to content creation. It's still an interesting move, given the strong push towards short form video from social platforms, including YouTube. We'll definitely be watching this one closely! We have two exciting Instagram video updates this week, the first being that Instagram is adding auto captions to feed videos and Reels. This is huge news for the deaf and hard of hearing community and makes video uploading more seamless for creators. Additionally, because videos typically play on mute by default, this is a welcome update among the creator community. Another big video announcement out of Instagram this week is the official shutting down of the IGTV app. Last year Instagram announced that IGTV would be going away, replaced simply by ""Instagram Video"", encapsulating feed videos, Lives, and Reels. This change means that in-stream video ads (also known as IGTV Ads) will also be going away, reducing monetization options for some creators. But Instagram is clearly putting Reels front and center, so we will probably be seeing more monetization abilities for Reels this year. Pinterest has added Hebrew language support to the platform, citing that there are ""more than *55 million Pins in Hebrew already on Pinterest,"" and they ""want to make it even easier for Pinners to discover fresh ideas and get inspired for their life's projects in their preferred language."" Users can access this additional language option for Pinterest through the settings on their iPhone or Android device. LinkedIn has acquired Israel based data analytics platform Oribi in order to facilitate better marketing on the platform. From LinkedIn: ""Through the integration of Oribi's technology into our marketing solutions platform, our customers will benefit from enhanced campaign attribution to optimize the ROI of their advertising strategies."" This announcement also included the news that LinkedIn will be opening an office in Tel Aviv. Update from February 22nd LinkedIn is creating more ways for single-person businesses (such as freelancers, consultants, and contractors) to promote their work and services. Now these accounts can link their single-admin company page to their personal LinkedIn profile, under ""services"". This is a small but significant update that will make it easier to facilitate more seamless networking opportunities. For the geriatric millennials out there who remember signing up for their first AOL messenger account or Hotmail email, this story will resonate. Snapchat will now allow users to change their username, and people who signed up in the app's infancy are understandably excited. Finally those regrettable middle-school aged usernames can glow-up right along with you. In a small but useful update, you can now pin DM messages within Twitter. Users can pin up to 6 conversations for easier access. This will be especially nice for businesses who need to track important customer service questions, influencer outreach, and other time-sensitive messages. Reddit is leaning into more visual-heavy posts, an interesting move for the platform which has been largely text-heavy. But now, Reddit is adding more visual editing tools in-app to encourage more image sharing. The editing options are similar to what you can find in Instagram Stories. Currently this update is only available on iOS devices, with Android to be rolled out soon. The latest platform to push its short form video feature is Meta, which will roll out Facebook Reels to all users. This feature had previously only been available to some users, but has now expanded to 150 more countries. They've also added the option to save drafts, and new ""clipping"" functionality to enable a workaround for longer videos. Update from February 15th Thought LinkedIn's primary purpose as a professional networking social platform has remained unchanged, an uptick in more personal status updates and politically leaning posts was probably inevitable. In response to those wishing to maintain a more professional environment, LinkedIn is offering the option to ""mute"" posts containing political content. If only this were available in real life office situations… Big news for Instagram content creators! Instagram has added a private ""like"" button for Stories, which will help creators gain more engagement data to determine how their Stories are perceived. Likes are hidden from viewers and while a cumulative number is not available, Story creators can see who's liked by a red heart next to the username, when they expand the Stories view sheet. Twitter is making it easier for users to identify bot tweets through a public tag. This will be extremely helpful to users to be able to quickly see if they're interacting with a bot, as well as differentiate between ""good"" bots and ""bad"" bots. Important to note, however, that adding this label is voluntary and not required on the part of developers behind automated Tweets. YouTube continues their foray into highlighting and encouraging short-form video content with a new dedicated upload section on users channels. If a creator has made YouTube Shorts, they will now appear here, for easier access and, YouTube likely hopes, higher engagement. It's also a way to encourage more creators to make Shorts as a supplementary video type on their channel. https://twitter.com/Snapchat/status/1494030899410882561 In partnership with Ticketmaster, Snapchat has added a Map overlay feature (called Snap Map) that shows upcoming events and entertainment happening nearby to your location. Users can swipe through to find what interests them, share with friends, and purchase tickets all from within the app. Users will be able to cater their experience through setting alerts for certain types of events. Update from February 8th On Safer Internet Day this week, Instagram announced it would be testing an option to help users who've been locked out of their accounts. The feature will allow users to reach out to friends for identity verification, so that Instagram can safely re-open the account for that user. Instagram says it will be sharing more information soon, as the feature is very new. Social platforms are continuing to experiment with audio features and Reddit is no exception. The site launched ""Reddit Talk"" in April 2021 and recently announced that they were expanding upon this offering and opening it up to more users. New features include recording capability, text and emoji responses, and a ""live bar"" to showcase live discussions happening when you log in. Some of the biggest news to come out this week is Twitter testing the waters with long form posting options called ""Articles"". This feature is in the very beginning stages and has not been rolled out to a wide audience yet. It's currently unclear just how ""Articles"" will work or how they'll be posted to your Twitter page. In a world so used to threads and short copy, is there space for long-form content on Twitter? We are definitely anxious to find out! Just in time for Valentine's Day, Messenger has added some new features to their app. These include improvements to voice messages like a preview feature and a longer duration available, a Venmo-esque addition allowing you to split bills, and virtual Valentines stickers and filters for Messenger Kids. In the wake of announcing that YouTube's original programming will officially be a thing of the past, the video sharing platform has announced a number of new features people should look out for in 2022. As the world continues to go the direction of short-form video, YouTube Shorts are getting a lot of special treatment: better ways to create branded content, chat features, and shopping are all on the docket. YouTube will also continue finding ways to help creators monetize and partner with brands, as well as improving their community features. New shopping capabilities through YouTube are also on the horizon. Update from 2/1/22 Up to four options rather than two are now available in Instagram Stories polls! If you've ever not answered a poll because neither answer fit, or you wanted a ""both"" option, those days are over. Which is also good news for social media managers trying to capture those taps for engagement metrics. Posters can also now update the color of the poll question text, allowing for more brand alignment. It's Black History Month! Companies and brands around the world are celebrating in various ways. The Metaverse launched the ""Metaverse Culture Series"" which will use VR and AR to help amplify black voices through collaborations with black creators, and provide educational resources on black culture and history. Importantly, the series will run for a full year, rather than just the month of February. Privacy concerns have been at the forefront of social media users minds for several years, and a new study from Snapchat reveals that actually having tools to control their privacy is more important for Gen Z and millennial users than a ""privacy policy"". The report found that ""only 65% of respondents are actually satisfied with their online privacy"" and so having better options for controlling what they share is a priority. Another social platform dedicated to elevating black creators this month is Pinterest. Continuing their new livestream shopping endeavor ""Pinterest TV"", which launched just before the holidays, Pinterest will be ""amplifying Black creator content through a Pinterest TV series focused around Nourishing Your Soul, working with inspiring creators across food, fashion, beauty and wellness."" A new toolbox hub from Twitter aims to help marketers quickly access all the features, apps, and resources they need to improve their Twitter marketing prowess. The Hub includes links to a number of 3rd party apps and sites, broken up into three sections: Expression tools, Safety tools, and Measurement tools. It remains to be seen how long the hub will be active or if it will change as Twitter promotes more of its internal tools, but for now it's a great way for marketers to keep up! Update from January 25th TikTok is planning a few new features, currently in experiment mode and not yet being tested live. These include a customizable avatar similar to Apple's ""Memoji"" in look and feel, audio-only live streaming which gives creators more options to build their audience, and a creator subscription model, akin to what Instagram is currently testing. Twitter's newest upcoming feature is called ""Flocks"" and it will enable users to share Tweets with a select group, rather than publicly. It is similar to ""close friends"" in Instagram Stories which allows you to only show your Story to people on your close friends list. Twitter already offers control over who can see and post replies, so Flocks can add an extra level of protection as well as the ability to create conversation between a close knit group. In a continuing effort to prevent the spread of hate speech and misinformation, Instagram has announced that it will now demote posts that are detected by the algorithm to contain hate speech or bullying, or that may incite violence. Instagram already shows posts lower on feeds that are reported by independent fact checkers, so this is essentially a step toward automating the process and catching posts that aren't reported. Meta business platform, Workplace, announced last year that it would be implementing a WhatsApp integration to help facilitate communication between remote teams. In particular the update aims to make it easier for frontline workers to stay connected, ensuring ""that information and updates reach frontline workers where they are in real-time."" There's no question that the working world is rapidly changing and a new ad for LinkedIn illustrates how the professional networking site is adapting to accommodate these changes. The promotional video focuses on the changing nature of what it means to be a ""professional"" and what work-from-home means for work-life balance. Update from January 18th The power of manifestation is the subject of the latest ad campaign for Twitter. Billboards have started showing up in various cities, showcasing famous athletes and entertainers early Tweets with career aspirations and dreams. Today these dreams have been realized, and it's a nice reminder of the power of intention setting. Sometimes publicly sending your aspirations out into the universe (or on Twitter) can have powerful results! TikTok Tests Integrated Stories TikTok is in the early stages of testing a more integrated experience for its Stories feature. While currently Stories on TikTok live in their own separate space, this change would include them in the ""For You"" and ""Following"" sections of the app. Navigation to Stories creation would also now be available from your main feed as well. Users scrolling through will see how many cards each Story contains and can tap through to view from right within their main feed, which is the biggest difference from Instagram's Stories. Pinterest Shares How the Male Demographic Uses Pins While Pinterests primary demographic is women, a new report indicates that more men are using the platform today, and takes a look at what they're interested in. The study reveals that men are making big goals and spending decisions for 2022. According to Pinterest: ""75% of men in our study are planning to spend more this year to bring their goals to fruition... the study showed a mix of big-picture intention setting (eat better, find work-life balance) and smaller shifts to have more fun (socialize more, spend more time with friends)."" Snapchat Adds More Protections for Minors In a move similar to one made by Instagram in 2021, Snapchat announced plans to make its platform a safer place for minors. The platform will be adding more safeguards to its ""Quick Add"" suggestions feature to prevent users under 18 from being connected to and contacted by adults they don't know. Approximately 20% of Snapchats user base is under 18. YouTube Adds a ""Media Kit"" YouTube has introduced an exciting new addition called ""Media Kit"" to help creators share their audience and engagement metrics more efficiently and effectively with brands and advertisers. This will make it easier for creators to earn ad revenue and partner with more brands who are interested in getting in front of relevant influencer audiences. Update from January 11th While ""sound off"" is the default setting for most platforms when showing videos, TikTok is taking the opposite route. With 9 out of 10 TikTok users viewing sounds as essential, the platform seeks to expand their audio offerings and explore the continuing evolution of how sound is used to create content on TikTok. Audio is a key component to TikTok content, and with its popularity it will be interesting to see if other platforms will eventually switch from sound-off to sound-on by default. Pinterest has made it easier to find specific profiles and creators with a new filter that shows up in search results. The feature showcases Pinners related to certain search terms, so users can identify new people to follow who match their interests. In what promises to be an eventful year of changes and new features, Instagram is coming in hot out the gate, testing an option that will allow users to rearrange their grid post photos and videos. This would be a welcome addition for content creators on the platform, giving more control over the first posts people see when they visit your profile. Instagram has also teased the possibility of a ""pinned post"" to come later this year. A new privacy center is now available on Facebook, describing in fuller detail how Meta gathers and uses data, with more control for users to decide what they want to share. There are five different sections where people can find more information about privacy: Security, Sharing, Collection, Use, and Ads. Currently the new center is only available to US users on desktop, with plans to roll it out to a wider base soon. Given the popularity of video and reaction-posts on platforms like Instagram Reels and TikTok, it was only a matter of time before Twitter tried to get in on the action. They are currently testing a new ""live reactions"" feature as an additional sharing option. The feature allows users to quote-Tweet with a full screen video response with the quoted Tweet visible. Update from December 14th Instagram is continuing its race to keep up with TikTok, adding a new feature that allows users to reply to photo or video comments with an Instagram Reel. This functionality is already available on TikTok, so it's clear that Instagram wants to make sure its users have access to the same types of features as its biggest rival. The further integration of short-form video as replies will boost engagement and encourage content creators to make more Reels (we'll likely start to see a subculture of ""response Reels"" before long!). Audio features are set to be a continuing social media trend and WhatsApp is getting in on the action with a new feature enabling users to preview voice messages before sending. In an age where leaving a voicemail causes anxiety for an entire generation, this update is a welcome and useful option. You can play your message back and make sure it sounds the way you intended before sending. No more off-the-cuff rambling or robotic script reading! In an intriguing update for YouTube creators, the video platform recently launched ""Places Mentioned"". This is a new feature where any places mentioned in your video will show up visually in the video description box, so viewers can easily get more information about locations highlighted in your content. The feature essentially lessens the manual work on creators to add links, making it a more seamless and easy process. It's unclear at this juncture if the feature is only available on mobile devices. It's considered best practice these days to always include captions on videos. Not only are they helpful for deaf & hard of hearing viewers, they also helps clarify what's said if the audio is muffled, and additionally most videos play without sound by default so they are an easy ways for viewers to decide whether or not they'd like to engage further with the video by turning the sound on. Auto-captions will now be available for Twitter videos, automatically turned on for all videos uploaded on iOS and Android, while desktop users can switch them on and off manually. Currently Twitter video captions are available in 37 languages. Update from December 7th In a bid to join other top social platforms like Instagram and TikTok in a ""video first"" mentality, Pinterest recently announced that it would be acquiring video editing app, Vochi. According to Vochi CEO & Founder: ""The Vochi app gives creators the ability to apply high quality effects based on computer vision on objects in a video instantly...These technologies are unique in the industry, and we're excited to bring them to an even larger audience as a part of the Pinterest team."" Although the old roundup style from YouTube is still on ice due to negative feedback in recent years, YouTube has still provided those who are curious with some top trends and YouTube creators from the past year. The selections are divided into 5 sections: Trending Videos, Music Videos, Top Creators, Breakout Creators, Shorts Creators, plus an additional section highlighting featured creators from a Livestream event Escape2021. From the results, it's clear that gaming, music, and vlogging remain popular, but the TikTok format is also becoming more popular in the YouTube Shorts community. New features are now available to users on LinkedIn using Creator Mode, including Live Videos and Newsletters. Creator mode is an option for LinkedIn users who use the platform beyond core networking. Per LinkedIn: ""LinkedIn creators are members who regularly share content with their professional community to demonstrate their expertise, ignite conversations about ideas and experiences, and build communities around common interests."" These power users and thought leaders now have access to create LinkedIn Lives and authoring Newsletters that get seen by your followers through automated emails. These features are already available to business pages with 150+ followers. Messenger has been making some significant updates and changes throughout the year to elevate it's experience for users. Their most recent addition includes AR features, new sound-mojis, including one from Taylor Swift and one celebrating popular Netflix series Stranger Things. Most notably however, is a Venmo-esque payment option that Messenger is testing called ""Split Payments."" * Original Link Disclaimer Meltwater NV published this content on 20 September 2022 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

Meta_Facebook,Sandberg Set To Exit Meta Post in Fall --- Driver of Facebook's business side for 14 years will remain on the company's board,2 June 2022,The Wall Street Journal,"1,024 words",0.9886,0.088,0.04,0.872,"Sheryl Sandberg on Wednesday said that she will be leaving her role as chief operating officer of Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., closing out her tenure helping lead one of the world's most profitable and controversial companies. In a post on her Facebook profile, Ms. Sandberg said she will continue to serve as a member of Meta's board. In a securities filing, Meta said that she informed the company on Saturday of her intention to resign. Ms. Sandberg said her late husband told her she should take the job if she was planning to stay five years, and she stayed for 14. ""I really feel like the next generation of leaders are ready,"" Ms Sandberg said in an interview. ""It's been a long and great partnership with Mark, I really believe in the company, and I'm staying on the board. But it's probably time for me to have more flexibility and more ability to do more things with my time."" Javier Olivan, currently chief growth officer, will take over as the company's COO when Ms. Sandberg leaves. During her time as the company's COO, Ms. Sandberg built out the business side of the company, turning a free-to-access social media startup founded in a Harvard dorm room into one of the biggest advertising companies on the planet. Last year, the company reported nearly $115 billion in advertising revenue. Ms. Sandberg was the longtime lieutenant to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, and in that role -- and as the author of the leadership book ""Lean In"" -- became one of the most prominent women in business. Ms. Sandberg, 52 years old, said that she was looking forward to spending more time on her foundation and women's issues. Beyond that, she's not sure about what her life after Facebook will look like. ""This will be a chance to take a breath and figure it out,"" she said. ""This job and that kind of thought process really can't coexist."" Ms. Sandberg has been telling people that she feels burned out and that she has become a punching bag for the company's problems, according to people familiar with the matter. At Mr. Zuckerberg's direction, the company is also pivoting to a future focused on the development of virtual worlds -- known as the metaverse -- and that is less dependent on advertising, which has long been Ms. Sandberg's fiefdom. Ms. Sandberg has been notably absent from many of the meetings about the company's metaverse plans, said some of the people. ""Sheryl architected our ads business, hired great people, forged our management culture, and taught me how to run a company,"" Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a post on Wednesday. ""She created opportunities for millions of people around the world, and she deserves the credit for so much of what Meta is today."" As part of the reshuffling, Marne Levine, the company's chief business officer, will report to Mr. Olivan. ""I don't plan to replace Sheryl's role in our existing structure,"" Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. ""I'm not sure that would be possible since she's a superstar who defined the COO role in her own unique way."" ""But even if it were possible, I think Meta has reached the point where it makes sense for our product and business groups to be more closely integrated,"" Mr. Zuckerberg added. Ms. Sandberg received total compensation of $35.2 million in 2021, and owned about 1.5 million shares as of last month, according to Meta's securities filings -- worth around $277 million at Wednesday's closing price. Her net worth is estimated at $1.6 billion, according to Forbes. Meta's share price has fallen by about half from its peak last year, amid struggles in its core advertising business and a broader selloff of tech stocks. Shares ended down 2.6% on Wednesday. Before her arrival at Facebook, Ms. Sandberg was vice president of global online sales and operations at Google. After joining Facebook, when Mr. Zuckerberg was only 23 years old, Ms. Sandberg became the company's business strategist and resident grown-up, with direct responsibility for advertising sales, legal and policy issues. That structure allowed Mr. Zuckerberg to focus on engineering challenges. As the company grew into a tech giant, Ms. Sandberg's profile rose along with it. She wrote two bestselling books and was a regular at high-profile gatherings of influential political figures and business executives. Ms. Sandberg's husband, Dave Goldberg, died in 2015 while the two were vacationing in Mexico. Her grief and how she recovered from it were the subject of her second book, called ""Option B."" In recent years, Facebook became embroiled in a series of issues including data privacy and user safety, and Ms. Sandberg's role leading the company led to intense criticism at times. In 2018, Ms. Sandberg testified before Congress about election interference involving social media. That same year, The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Zuckerberg told Ms. Sandberg that he blamed her and her teams for the public fallout over Cambridge Analytica, the research firm that accessed private data on Facebook users and used it for political research. Ms. Sandberg later confided in friends that she wondered if she should be worried about her job. Last year the Journal wrote a series of investigative stories, called The Facebook Files, about the flaws in the company's platforms and the harms they cause users, among other issues. One article cited internal data to show that Ms. Sandberg's portfolio within the company, as measured by staffers that report to her, has been shrinking in recent years. In her post announcing her departure, Ms. Sandberg paid tribute to Mr. Zuckerberg: ""In the critical moments of my life, in the highest highs and in the depths of true lows, I have never had to turn to Mark, because he was already there."" --- Emily Glazer and Deepa Seetharaman contributed to this article."
Meta_Facebook,Sandberg Built Facebook Ad Machine Now Under Attack,3 June 2022,The Wall Street Journal,714 words,0.9718,0.089,0.051,0.86,"Sheryl Sandberg created an advertising machine for Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. that capitalized on user data and fueled its business for more than a decade. Now, she is stepping down as chief operating officer as that model is under attack. Ms. Sandberg's departure comes less than a year after the exit of former ad sales head Carolyn Everson, another leader with strong ties on Madison Avenue. Meta is reckoning with a renewed focus on user privacy -- accelerated by a change Apple Inc. made in its platforms -- that is undermining its advantages in the ad marketplace and slowing the company's growth. Meanwhile, many marketers are pushing Meta to do more to control objectionable content such as hate speech and misinformation. And the company faces a fearsome competitor in TikTok. ""The No. 1 task for Meta with the departure of excellent leaders such as Carolyn Everson and Sheryl Sandberg is to find someone who is completely focused on the advertising community and recognizes the enormous opportunity that they have to restore credibility in the platform,"" said Lou Paskalis, a former marketing executive at Bank of America. Facebook offered reassurances to advertising agencies in a memo on Wednesday. ""We remain confident in the road ahead and committed to offering the best ways to grow your business through a meaningful, durable connection with your customers -- right now, and into the metaverse tomorrow,"" the memo said. Meta has said it won't reassign Ms. Sandberg's exact role, but that veteran executive Javier Olivan will be the new chief operating officer, responsible for ad and business products, marketing and other areas. Ms. Sandberg will remain on Facebook's board. In an email to top ad executives to inform them about her departure, Ms. Sandberg said, ""One of the highlights of my time with Meta has been getting to know partners like you,"" according to a copy viewed by The Wall Street Journal. ""You've shared invaluable, sometimes tough, feedback along the way -- pushing us and making us better,"" she wrote. A key figure to watch is Meta's chief business officer, Marne Levine, ad executives said. Ms. Levine has been making the rounds with brands and agencies but has yet to build the strong relationships that Ms. Everson and Ms. Sandberg have, some ad buyers said. Ms. Sandberg, who joined Facebook in 2008, has played a variety of roles in building up its ad business. She was an internal evangelist, a pitchwoman to Madison Avenue and a crisis manager. Though her interactions with marketers and agencies have become less frequent in recent years, ad executives said she left a lasting impact on the online advertising world. ""She was the catalyst for getting marketers to go more and more digital,"" said Joe Tripodi, a former chief marketing officer for brands such as Coca-Cola, Subway and Allstate. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg delegated the monetization of Facebook's huge user base mostly to Ms. Sandberg. She persuaded him to become more aggressive around a decade ago in capitalizing on the vast amounts of user data Facebook captured on its own platform and from sites across the web. Meanwhile, Ms. Sandberg preached the benefits of digital advertising to chief marketing officers and persuaded them to move money to Facebook. She was also known to pitch chief executives and board members, according to marketing and agency executives. Ms. Sandberg, who earlier had a career in politics as the chief of staff to former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, went to great lengths to woo brands and develop relationships at every turn, from ski trips to meetings at industry festivals. Big marketers were sometimes dinner guests at Ms. Sandberg's home. Sam Bloom, chief executive of Dallas-based digital ad agency Camelot Strategic Marketing & Media, said after his brother-in-law died, Ms. Sandberg sent his widow, a senior marketing executive, a signed copy of her book ""Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience and Finding Joy,"" about Ms. Sandberg's own grief after losing her husband. In recent years, Ms. Everson had more face time with advertisers and was seen by many as their go-to person, ad executives said. --- Patrick Coffee contributed to this article."
Meta_Facebook,Back in Business,5 November 2021,The Wall Street Journal Online,"1,070 words",0.9649,0.086,0.062,0.852,"Back in Business is an occasional column that puts the present day in perspective by looking at business history and those who shaped it. Read previous installments of the column here . Facebook Inc.'s name change to Meta (short for Meta Platforms Inc.) is sure to transform the company's image, although perhaps not in ways Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg intended. The names of people, things—and businesses—shape how we perceive them. Every parent has had the experience of naming a baby and then exclaiming that the newborn suddenly ""is"" its new name. Likewise, a company that changes its name changes its image in everyone else's eyes. Facebook is far from the first company that has sought to revamp its image this way. History suggests, however, that a corporate re-christening can create a big problem: A new name, catchy and short, can come to embody everything people already disliked about a company but weren't previously able to articulate. Look what happened after Tribune Publishing Co. changed its name to tronc Inc. in 2016. The company variously described its new name as a mashup of ""Tribune Online Content"" or as the British term for a restaurant-tip box in which money is pooled for later distribution. The idea seemed to be that tronc Inc. would pool the world's news and parcel it out to consumers online. Yet, while it called itself "" the next media company ,"" tronc was jettisoning some of its best assets. The name made the company's travails inescapable. Soon, comedian John Oliver was exclaiming that tronc ""sounds like the noise an ejaculating elephant makes."" Here's a more serious example of a name change that closed minds instead of opening them. In early 1987, UAL Inc., the parent of United Airlines, announced it would change its name to Allegis Corp. Seeking to expand its Hertz, Hilton and Westin units, the company wanted to signify that it wasn't merely an airline, but also a car-rental and hotel-room provider. Investors didn't like that concept, which others had already unsuccessfully tried—and the name Allegis quickly came to epitomize the company's unpopular strategy. The late-night television host Johnny Carson even mocked the name in one of his monologues. One disgruntled shareholder was an opportunistic real-estate developer named Donald Trump, who had bought nearly 5% of the company's stock. He said the name Allegis sounded like ""the next world-class disease."" It made him ""more militant as an investor and more willing to speak out against management, because I thought it was so wrong,"" Mr. Trump said in June 1987 . ""And I think it had an important psychological role. It brought out even more anger at management and made a lot of people say they had finally had it."" That's because a name is easier to criticize than a strategy, says Margaret Wolfson, founder of River and Wolf LLC, a naming agency in New York. ""To talk about a strategy takes a lot more time and analysis,"" she says. ""But names are handles: They're easy to grab onto, and criticizing them can turn into a blood sport."" When veteran airline executive Stephen Wolf came in as Allegis' chief executive at the end of 1987, he was ""indifferent to the name,"" he told me this week, but focused on changing the strategy to shed the non-airline assets. In May 1988, shareholders voted to ditch Allegis and rename the company UAL Corp.—almost exactly the same as its previous identity. To me, what's most remarkable about this story is that Allegis doesn't seem to be such a bad name after all. Consider a giant staffing and business-services firm founded in 1983 and based in Hanover, Md. With approximately 20,000 employees and more than $12 billion in annual revenue, it ranked 22nd on Forbes' 2020 list of largest private companies in the U.S. Launched in 1983 as Aerotek Inc., the firm rebranded itself in 2001. Its new name? Allegis Group. Plenty of people ridiculed Facebook for changing its name to Meta—joking that it's short for "" metastasizing ,"" or "" I meta girl "" who became an antivaxer, and so forth—but the risk isn't that people won't like the name. It's that they'll like it too well—as a pithy incarnation of everything they dislike about the company. Mr. Zuckerberg has said that it's ""sort of a ridiculous thing"" to suggest that the name change is meant to drown out negative publicity, such as The Wall Street Journal's revelations earlier this year about Facebook's marketing and other practices. Instead, the renaming demonstrates the company's commitment to the metaverse , or the emerging digital world in which people can shop, socialize, work and play almost without limit. Facebook's appeal among younger users of its traditional services is fading , so the company is moving into the metaverse. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How might Facebook's name change affect its future as a business? Join the conversation below. The Meta name imparts more urgency to that mission. As Mr. Zuckerberg wrote at the end of October, ""I hope people around the world come to know the Meta brand and the future we stand for."" What isn't clear is how much time and energy everyone will want to commit to that future. Some consumers will love it. To others, it might sound like a dystopia of ""living"" on a video screen while eating cold pizza alone in a windowless basement, almost never seeing another human face-to-face. The Latin saying ""nomen est omen"" can be loosely translated as ""your name is your fate."" By renaming itself Meta, Facebook has identified itself inextricably with a metaverse future. In the eyes of the public, the business will become what it is named. That could end up making the company even more of a lightning rod for criticism than it already is.

Meta_Facebook,Facebook’s Bet on E-Commerce Remains a Work in Progess as Meta Looks to Revamp its Ads Business,3 May 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,365 words",0.9872,0.072,0.021,0.908,"English , Inc. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. developed e-commerce services in 2020 as people shopped more from home and the company faced a changing digital ad market. Two years later, employees, former executives and retailers say the division remains a work in progress. Some retailers say they are frustrated by Meta’s e-commerce rollout, noting that the service is missing basic components such as the ability to offer items in different colors or sizes, limit where a merchant can ship items and provide next-day or same-day deliveries. Other stores, though, see the promise of connecting with shoppers through the large user bases of Facebook and Instagram. At least five senior executives have left in the past six months, according to a former senior executive in the division. Facebook is confident in its e-commerce business. “Building a full-fledged commerce platform is a multiyear journey—one that became a company priority less than two years ago,” said Joe Osborne, a spokesperson for Meta. “We’re proud of our progress and in the teams working to build out these experiences.” Meta began ramping up its efforts in e-commerce during the early days of the pandemic, launching features called Facebook and Instagram Shops in May 2020. The shops let brands post their catalogs directly on Facebook and Instagram. Some brands use the shops to direct users to purchase on their websites while others choose to sell the items to users via Meta’s services. Meta also started bracing for the impact of privacy changes Apple Inc. announced in June 2020 for its iPhone and iPad devices. Those changes, which rolled out in April 2021, allowed users to opt out of having their activity on their devices tracked by companies like Meta. That tracking data was critical to how Meta measures the effectiveness of advertisements. The loss of that data drove advertisers elsewhere, putting a major dent in the company’s earnings for the past two quarters. Since February, when Meta posted disappointing user growth and revenue and said Apple’s new policy would cost more than $10 billion in lost sales for 2022, the company’s shares have dropped more than 34%. That is equivalent to a loss of $307.8 billion in market value. About 97% of Meta’s revenue comes from advertising, according to its first-quarter results. Meta also said it would be spending more as the company pivots to the metaverse, a virtual world where people work, play and interact. Online shopping offers a way to ease the impact from the Apple changes. By developing channels of commerce within its apps, Meta can measure the effectiveness of ads within its own services and reclaim some of the data it lost. The potential is significant: Amazon.com Inc., which dominates in e-commerce, reported $7.88 billion in ad sales in its most recent quarter, a 23% increase from the same period a year ago. Meta doesn’t break out results from its shopping business, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last week that the company recently saw a pullback in e-commerce usage. Other online retailers, like Amazon, have also talked about an e-commerce slowdown as more Covid-19 restrictions are lifted and people return to in-person shopping in recent months. “Other challenges are broader macro trends, like the softness in e-commerce after the acceleration we saw during the pandemic,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. Among commerce’s most notable departures are Vice President of Commerce Business and Operations Gene Alston, who announced in Meta’s Workplace recently that he would be leaving the company, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Alston had been responsible for all strategy and teams for commerce products across Meta’s family of apps. Roi Tiger, vice president of engineering for commerce across the company, also announced his departure on Workplace, according to a person familiar with the matter. Eddie Garcia, who previously served as chief product officer for Sam’s Club and was brought in last June to run the company’s Marketplace feature, left the company in March and was recently announced as eBay Inc.’s chief product officer. Chris Olaniran is a user who wanted to create an Instagram Shop for his clothing brand, Vital Clothing. That process required setups on both Facebook and Instagram, and in Mr. Olaniran’s case, on Shopify Inc., a Canadian e-commerce company that he uses to host his online store. “This is where I first realized, OK, this is a lot more complicated than I thought,” he said. After making the necessary changes to both his Instagram and Facebook accounts, linking them to his product catalog in Shopify and getting approval to sell, Mr. Olaniran struggled to get all of his items to appear in the shop. He said he never figured out how to get changes to his product catalog to show up. “You would think that there would be some sort of accessible method of support, but after trying to solve the issue myself, it really became apparent that it’s really the exact opposite,” he said. Meta said businesses can get support in a number of ways and pointed to an online help center. Mr. Olaniran eventually abandoned the idea of having an Instagram Shop. “I’ve started the process of setting up an Etsy store to have in combination with my website,” he said. “It just really comes down to, is it worth my time?” Meta recently began showing a promotion to Instagram users, offering them 20% off when they make their first e-commerce order through the social network. More notably, the company is set to expand the availability of ads within the Facebook and Instagram Shops feature, a format it announced in June 2021, in which ads send users to curated collections from a shop or a business’s website. There are approximately 200 sellers doing early testing of Shops ads, according to a Meta employee. For many well-established retailers and brands, Facebook and Instagram Shops represent a tantalizing glimpse into the future. Michael Karanikolas, co-founder and co-CEO of influencer-driven apparel brand Revolve Group, told investors last May that Instagram Shops is a “very small” contributor to the company’s bottom line. “We think long term [Instagram shopping] is a part of the overall suite of options that we have for our customer,” he said. Kevin Gould, founder and CEO of Kombo Ventures, a holding company with brands that sell products on Instagram, said he would like to see Meta do a large awareness campaign introducing Facebook and Instagram Shops to users. Better integration with Shopify, and adding features like discount code support, would make the commerce offerings more compelling, he said. Some merchants are seeing sales growth through Facebook and Instagram Shops. Facebook and Instagram drive about 50% of revenue for BlendJet Inc., a portable blender company, said CEO Ryan Pamplin, but most of that comes from ads that point consumers to BlendJet’s website. In recent months, the company has seen an uptick in sales directly on its Facebook and Instagram Shops, Mr. Pamplin said. This year through April, BlendJet’s sales on Meta’s commerce features are up about 300% compared with the year-earlier period, he said. Mr. Pamplin attributed the uptick to a number of shopping features Meta has recently added, including product reviews and expanded product descriptions. Mr. Pamplin said some important features are still missing—most notably the ability to add more than one photo for each color of a product or the ability to include videos for products—but he said he has faith in Meta’s commerce teams. “I’ve been involved as an advertiser for a very long time, and I’ve adopted everything that they’ve come out with,” Mr. Pamplin said. “And, you know, I’m loyal to the results.” and Charity L.

Meta_Facebook,Texas Sues Meta Over Facebook’s Facial-Recognition Practices,14 February 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,066 words",-0.4211,0.057,0.064,0.879,"English , Inc. The Texas attorney general filed a suit against Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. on Monday, charging that the social-media giant’s longstanding and now discontinued use of facial-recognition technology violated that state’s privacy protections for personal biometric data. The lawsuit, filed in state district court in Marshall by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, seeks civil penalties in the hundreds of billions of dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter. In a statement, Mr. Paxton said the company’s capture of facial geometry in photographs that users uploaded from 2010 to late last year resulted in “tens of millions of violations” of Texas law. “Facebook has been secretly harvesting Texans’ most personal information—photos and videos—for its own corporate profit,” Mr. Paxton said. “Texas law has prohibited such harvesting without informed consent for over 20 years. While ordinary Texans have been using Facebook to innocently share photos of loved ones with friends and family, we now know that Facebook has been brazenly ignoring Texas law for the last decade.” Facebook didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Facebook previously settled another lawsuit over its facial-recognition practices for about $650 million. That class-action suit filed in 2015 was brought under Illinois’s biometric privacy law, which is similar in some respects to the Texas law. Both laws require individuals’ consent before their biometric identifiers can be captured. In the class-action case, Facebook’s lawyers said the Illinois law didn’t apply to its method for identifying users in photos. The company also said it had given users the ability to opt out of the feature. Facebook’s efforts to dismiss the class-action case were unsuccessful, and the company settled the case in 2020. The Texas lawsuit—in particular the size of the civil penalties being sought—points to the impact that increasingly widespread privacy laws could have on big tech companies’ operations. After Facebook’s settlement of the Illinois class-action case became known, Texas sent its own civil subpoena to the company seeking information about the facial-recognition system. Facebook announced it was ending its facial recognition system last November. “These procedural protections are particularly crucial in our digital world because technology now permits the wholesale collection and storage of an individual’s unique biometric identifiers—identifiers that cannot be changed if compromised or misused,” U.S. District Judge James Donato wrote in the class-action case. “When an online service simply disregards the Illinois procedures, as Facebook is alleged to have done, the right of the individual to maintain her biometric privacy vanishes into thin air.” Texas says Facebook’s facial-recognition system ignored that state’s legal requirements for capturing users’ facial features. “For over a decade, while holding itself out as a trusted meeting place for Texans to connect and share special moments with family and friends, Facebook was secretly capturing, disclosing, unlawfully retaining—and profiting off of—Texans’ most personal and highly sensitive information: records of their facial geometries, which Texas law refers to as biometric identifiers,” the state argues, according to a draft of the complaint reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The Texas law makes it unlawful to capture people’s biometric identifiers without their informed consent and prohibits sharing that information. Unlike the Illinois law that led to the class-action suit, the Texas law can only be enforced by the state’s attorney general. The Texas law also provides for a penalty of $25,000 per violation. The complaint estimates that at least 20 million Texans were members of Facebook in 2021. The civil subpoena issued by Texas demanded all the materials that Facebook had produced in response to the class-action lawsuit. Facebook’s announcement that it would stop using its facial-recognition system cited public concern over the technology. “We’re shutting down the Face Recognition system on Facebook,” the company said in a blog post, explaining that it would “delete more than a billion people’s individual facial recognition templates.” It said that “the many specific instances where facial recognition can be helpful need to be weighed against growing concerns about the use of this technology as a whole.” Texas officials say in their suit that they are seeking to recover civil penalties for past violations of the law and that they would try to stop any future improper uses—suggesting Meta might still retain some of the facial-recognition data it collected. “Facebook announced, in November 2021, that it would cease use of the face-recognition feature on its Facebook social-media platform,” the draft complaint says. “Facebook has made no such commitment with respect to any of the other platforms or operations under its corporate umbrella, such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Reality Labs, or its upcoming virtual-reality metaverse.” In a blog post announcing that it was ending its use of facial recognition, Facebook said that it would “continue working on these technologies and engaging outside experts…[But] amid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate.” The Texas suit also says Facebook has obtained patents for systems “where consumers wandering in stores or standing at checkout counters have their faces scanned and matched with their social-networking profiles.” The Texas investigation itself might have slowed at least some of the facial-recognition system’s shutdown. Following the company’s announcement in early November, Texas authorities demanded that relevant data be preserved while the state investigated. In a follow-up letter on Nov. 10, Texas officials said Facebook had confirmed that Meta “will not delete any source code related to Facebook’s Facial Recognition system,” and would “preserve all metadata related to the system” including data sufficient to identify Texas users, which users had facial recognition enabled, and which users had face templates saved. Facebook said it believed the face templates themselves weren’t material and could be deleted, according to the Nov. 10 letter from the Texas attorney general’s office. The attorney general’s office expressed concern about that, and demanded that Meta not delete any face template information for past or present Texas residents.

Meta_Facebook,EU Alleges Antitrust Violations At Meta,20 December 2022,The Wall Street Journal,620 words,-0.7876,0.051,0.065,0.884,"BRUSSELS -- The European Union charged Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. with antitrust violations for allegedly distorting competition by tying its online classified ad service to its social network. The European Commission, the bloc's antitrust enforcer, on Monday issued a charge sheet against Meta that said the company automatically gives Facebook users access to its Marketplace service, potentially pushing aside competing classified-ad services. The commission said it is also concerned that Meta imposes unfair conditions on competing classified advertising services that use Facebook or Instagram, which is also owned by Meta. The company's terms and conditions authorize Meta to use advertising data from third parties to benefit its Marketplace service, the commission said. The EU first opened an investigation into the company's behavior involving the Marketplace service last year. ""Meta reaches globally billions of monthly users and millions of active advertisers"" through Facebook, said Margrethe Vestager, who leads the bloc's competition enforcement. By tying Facebook to the company's classified ad service, she said, ""Facebook users have no choice but to have access to Facebook Marketplace."" Meta said that it disputes the commission's charges. It said Facebook users that automatically get access to Marketplace are free to decide if they want to use it. The company said Marketplace offers an alternative to large and established e-commerce advertisers such as Amazon.com Inc. and that it doesn't use data from other classified-ad services to compete with them. ""We will continue to work with regulatory authorities to demonstrate that our product innovation is pro-consumer and pro-competitive,"" said Tim Lamb, Meta's head of competition for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The charges against Meta are part of a wave of antitrust enforcement from the EU's antitrust regulators in recent years. The EU last year filed antitrust charges against Apple Inc. for allegedly abusing its control over the distribution of music-streaming apps, including Spotify Technology SA. It has also opened probes into other companies, including an investigation into allegations that Alphabet Inc.'s Google abuses its leading role in digital advertising. The European Commission has been investigating Meta for years on multiple fronts. Facebook and the commission have squabbled over access to internal documents as part of those investigations. The U.K.'s antitrust watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority, in March separately opened its investigation into whether Meta repurposes the data it gathers from advertisers to benefit its own services, including both its marketplace and dating service. The CMA case is ongoing. Meta will have an opportunity to argue its case before the commission makes a final decision. If the commission concludes the company breached antitrust rules, Meta could face a maximum fine of 10% of its global annual revenue. The EU separately on Monday said that it was closing its investigation into whether Meta and Google sought to illegally cooperate in digital advertising, a second time those claims have been dropped, after a U.S. court tossed them out in September. The EU had announced in March it would investigate a deal between the two companies called Jedi Blue, which emerged as part of a lawsuit brought two years ago by a group of U.S. states led by Texas. But a U.S. court in September tossed out the claims pertaining to the Jedi Blue ad agreement. On Monday, the European Commission said that it would drop the case because, after collecting evidence from the two companies and the ad tech sector, the regulator ""concluded that the evidence did not confirm its initial concerns."" Google and Meta have disputed the characterization of their deal as potentially anticompetitive."
Meta_Facebook,WSJ Podcast The Journal,7 March 2022,WSJ Podcasts,"2,510 words",0.9887,0.082,0.039,0.88,"Last month, Facebook's parent, Meta Platforms, forecasted the company would lose $10 billion in advertising revenue this year. Small business owner Martha Krueger explains why she stopped using the platforms, and WSJ reporter Salvador Rodriguez talks about how the company plans to address the exodus. Click here to listen to the podcast(""https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/facebook-10-billion-advertising-exodus/8344B400-334A-4317-BBF7-71771D46CCEB"") Kate Linebaugh: Martha Krueger is the owner of Giften Market, an online gift basket store. What's your favorite product? Martha Krueger: It's so hard to pick. I love our handmade apothecary items. So lavender-scented heat wraps for sore shoulders, things like that. Kate Linebaugh: You have these sophisticated-looking, wine-flavored gummies? Martha Krueger: They're delicious. Kate Linebaugh: From the get-go, Martha says she was counting on Facebook and Instagram to be the key to finding customers. Martha Krueger: I knew I would be able to get in front of the people that would be really interested in my products, and so that was kind of the first and the only major type of advertising that I did in launching the company. Kate Linebaugh: And Martha says those ads on Facebook and Instagram were really effective because Facebook's data machine could target the right people, the people interested in buying gift baskets. And the ads were cheap. Martha Krueger: You know, in the early days, I was able to get customers for $14 per customer acquisition. Sometimes as low as $4 or $8 for certain occasions. But really, the only thing holding me back in the early days was cash. I had to cap the amount of advertising spend per day just so that I wouldn't get more sales than I could handle. Kate Linebaugh: But last year, Martha noticed a change. Martha Krueger: So I had a strong Mother's Day. Mother's Day is one of our biggest gifting holidays. But right after Mother's Day, things got really slow. And it continued to kind of grind to a halt, I would even say, in early fall where it was... Sometimes with retail, there's sort of a summer lull and you can write it off as a variety of factors. But it was clear in early fall that Facebook had lost the ability to target my customer. Kate Linebaugh: Martha is one of thousands of business owners leaving Facebook and Instagram. And now, this exodus could cost Meta, their parent company, $10 billion this year alone. Welcome to The Journal, our show about money, business and power. I'm Kate Linebaugh. It's Monday, March 7th. Coming up on the show, why online advertisers are ditching Facebook. At the beginning of last month, Meta shocked investors. Speaker 3: Meta's epic crash, crash on Thursday roiled Wall Street. Speaker 4: Now Meta, the company that owns Facebook, saw its stock plunge more than 20% in after-hours trading after reporting disappointing quarterly results and saying it lost users. Speaker 5: It's going to cost Meta around $10 billion in sales this year. Kate Linebaugh: Meta lost more than $200 billion in market value that day. Meta executives said one of the main reasons the company had a rough quarter was because of something Apple did a year ago, when it announced a major change to the iPhone. Salvador Rodriguez: Previously, a lot of the apps on your iPhone could just track you without ever asking for permission. Kate Linebaugh: That's Salvador Rodriguez. He covers social media companies for The Wall Street Journal. Salvador Rodriguez: Apple rolled out an update to iOS 14 that introduced this privacy change. And basically, what you were being asked is are you okay with this app tracking you across the internet and across your device? Apple made it really easy to turn that off because basically all these apps had to ask everybody for permission to continue doing that. And I think as a society, people are becoming more aware of who and when they share their data. Kate Linebaugh: Apple made that change back in April. The company said its goal was to give users a better understanding of which apps are using their personal data and where that data is going. Sal says that for users, this mainly looked like pop-up notifications. Salvador Rodriguez: You might notice that there's more and more permissions that Apple's asking you to give away. And maybe it's cumbersome. But the difference is that now you're being asked to consent into these things, whereas before you were just giving that all away without anyone asking if you were cool with it. Kate Linebaugh: Apple has always had some privacy protections, but the difference now is it's easier than ever for users to opt out of tracking. Salvador Rodriguez: If you go into the settings of your iPhone, you would go into the Settings app. Kate Linebaugh: I go into Settings. I go down to Privacy. Salvador Rodriguez: Exactly. You go to Privacy, and I believe the second option should say Tracking. Kate Linebaugh: Tracking. Salvador Rodriguez: So you tap on that. And then basically, at the very top, it lets you turn off tracking for everything on your phone. Kate Linebaugh: Right. Allow apps to request to track. It's not even to allow them to track you. It's to allow them to ask to track you. Salvador Rodriguez: Right. Right. So this is just taking that permission away from everyone, not just Facebook. Kate Linebaugh: Sal says more than 80% of iPhone users now turn off tracking. That's a huge problem to Meta's ad business which relies on a lot of user data. That business is Meta's bread and butter. It was 97% of the company's entire revenue last year. How did Facebook react when Apple announced this change? Salvador Rodriguez: Facebook went on a marketing campaign arguing that this was going to hurt small businesses and their ability to reach customers, that this was going to drive up prices for them, that this was going to be really, really bad for small businesses, for the little guy was essentially Facebook's response. But at the end of the day, this impacts Facebook the most. Kate Linebaugh: Now, almost a year since Apple implemented its change, that impact on Meta has come into focus. Advertisers are jumping ship. Salvador Rodriguez: They're experimenting with Snapchat, with TikTok, Amazon, Walmart. They're trying to see what works. Because at the end of the day, if you're a small business, you were going to Facebook because it showed results. You weren't going to Facebook out of loyalty. And if Facebook is struggling and can't get the job done right now, that's unfortunate. And it's a headache that you got to deal with and a problem that you got to address. But if someone else takes care of the problem for you, who cares if it's on Facebook or Snapchat or TikTok as long as you keep your business running. Kate Linebaugh: Coming up, how Meta plans to recover. Meta was very clear, Facebook and Instagram are losing ad revenue. And Martha, who owns the gift basket company, is one of the advertisers who's moved on. She used to rely almost entirely on Meta's platforms for advertising. Martha Krueger: Nearly 100%. I mean, there was a small group of friends and family in the beginning. But when you launch a new website, it doesn't even really get indexed by search engines for six months or so. So there's very little organic website traffic. Kate Linebaugh: So it was integral? It was fundamental to the success of your company? Martha Krueger: Absolutely. Kate Linebaugh: After the privacy change, Meta was less able to identify potential customers for Martha. And when it did, it cost her more. By the fall, it was clear to Martha that Meta was no longer meeting her business's needs. Martha Krueger: So when I would log into the analytics on the ad dashboard, I could see where my cost to acquire a customer used to be $14 on average, it could go up a little or down a little over time, was now well over $100. Kate Linebaugh: Wow. Martha Krueger: And that's when I knew it was really bad. Nothing else changed. The creative was the same. The headlines that I knew worked, the targeting. Everything else in the campaign was the same as it had been, and these were the successful components that I had before. It was truly just this change that made such a big impact. Kate Linebaugh: So Martha basically abandoned Meta's advertising and started experimenting with its rivals. Martha Krueger: I had done some small tests on LinkedIn, TikTok, Pinterest, but I shifted all of my time and attention and budget over to Google. With the Google platform, there's search intent there. So people looking for get well soon care package, happy birthday gift for mom, I know that they're in a shopping mindset. And for me, that became the second-most efficient use of my ad spend. Compared to what Facebook and Instagram was, I knew I couldn't have that anymore. So where am I going to put my dollars now? Kate Linebaugh: And how much now are you paying per customer? Martha Krueger: $29 to acquire a customer, although there's quite a bit more volatility to that. Sometimes in a two-week span, it's quite a bit more expensive and then it evens out. So as of today, $29. Kate Linebaugh: So you've doubled your cost. Martha Krueger: Yes. Yes. Kate Linebaugh: Sal says Apple's privacy change didn't hit Google as hard as Meta because Google's advertising business is less reliant on tracking users personal data. Salvador Rodriguez: Google knows exactly what you're looking for. And even though Google tracks a lot of information about who you are, it really doesn't matter because you're going in there with a specific query. And essentially, Google is selling ads against that query. And the advertiser can purchase those ads with quite a bit of confidence that this person who's searching for flights to Hawaii is probably pretty determined to buy a flight to Hawaii. Kate Linebaugh: Other competitors, like Snap, TikTok, and Pinterest, are also luring customers from Meta. Some are even helping brands repurpose their old Facebook ads, making it easier than ever for businesses to ditch Facebook and try something new. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's CEO, said the company is working on rebuilding its digital ad infrastructure and is also strengthening its approach to privacy. Salvador Rodriguez: Moving forward, data privacy is only going to get more intense and that's going to pose a huge problem for Facebook, which has built their entire business model off of what privacy laws were back when they got started in the 2000s. And that's just simply not going to be the case anymore. So this means Facebook really needs to alter their business model and adapt or they're going to get left behind. Kate Linebaugh: Meta is also trying to address its advertising problems in another way, by investing in its short- form video product called Facebook Reels. Salvador Rodriguez: So Reels is their answer to TikTok. TikTok, when it exploded, specifically in the pandemic, it's that they have this video content format, it's short-form video, they're super viral, they're very funny, and it's a whole feed of them. And because the entire social media ecosystem has been shifting to that type of format, Facebook has been having to chase TikTok in that regard as well. Kate Linebaugh: Meta says that Reels is increasing growth on Facebook and Instagram, but Sal says it may not be a perfect solution to Meta's advertising problems. Salvador Rodriguez: The problem is that it's actually taken off so fast that it's starting to eat into the time that users spend on the normal feed and the time that they spend looking at stories. And the problem with that is that Facebook actually sells most of their ads against those content formats. And they haven't quite built up their ad ecosystem just yet for Reels. And so that's kind of the problem. Kate Linebaugh: So Reels is cannibalizing, if you will, attention off of the platforms where Facebook is actually selling ads. Salvador Rodriguez: Yeah. Cannibalizing is absolutely the correct term to use here. Reels is taking away users from the formats where the ads are really being sold. And the ads are just not being sold just yet on Reels. So it's probably good in the long term for Facebook that they were willing to do this, but right now it's really hurting them. Kate Linebaugh: Zuckerberg has said he's confident advertising will ramp up on Reels and the company will be able to transition its revenue streams. But until that happens, business owners like Martha are turning to other options. Martha Krueger: I think I didn't really need to branch out and experiment and do much outside of just these campaigns because they were working so well. But now, I'm spending a lot more time strengthening other aspects of the business, the website experience, email, search engine optimization, organic social media. There's a lot of untapped potential, and it's a good wake up call for myself as a business owner to make adjustments and to be open to trying new things. Kate Linebaugh: And you're not alone. A lot of small business advertising has shifted away from Facebook, and it caused a big drop in the company's stock, causing quite a rough month for the company. If you were to put together a gift basket for Mark Zuckerberg, what would you put in it? Martha Krueger: Oh my goodness. I would want Mark to try some of our best sellers, some award-winning coffee and treats and cookies and things. And just say, hey, Mark, your team's having a rough quarter. There's a lot of work to be done, but have some coffee, fuel up, and let's get back to work. We can get through this. Kate Linebaugh: Not a lavender kind of soothing thing for the shoulders? Martha Krueger: For Mark, no. No. I think we're going to go energizing and we're going to caffeinate him. And just keep pushing forward. It's not a time to kind of step back and relax and we'll tackle this later. Kate Linebaugh: That's all for today, Monday, March 7th.

Meta_Facebook,"Facebook Parent Meta to Cut 11,000 Staff -- 2nd Update",9 November 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"2,651 words",-0.9853,0.056,0.096,0.848,"English , Inc. Meta Platforms Inc. said it would cut more than 11,000 workers, or 13% of staff, embarking on the company's first broad restructuring to cope with a slumping digital-ad market and falling stock price. In a message to staff on Wednesday morning, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, would cut staff across all of its businesses, with its recruiting and business teams disproportionately affected. The company is also tightening its belt by reducing its office space, moving to desk sharing for some workers, and extending a hiring freeze through the first quarter of 2023. ""This is a sad moment, and there's no way around that,"" Mr. Zuckerberg wrote, adding that he had been wrong in assuming that an increase in online activity during the pandemic would continue. ""I got this wrong and I take responsibility for that."" In a call Tuesday with hundreds of top managers, Mr. Zuckerberg said he had been overoptimistic about growth and was accountable for the company's missteps, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. The layoffs are the first broad head-count reductions to occur in the company's 18-year history, and a signal of the increasing competitive and regulatory challenges facing Meta -- and the tech industry more broadly at a time of rising inflation and sluggish demand. Meta's stock has fallen more than 70% this year. The company has pointed to worsening macroeconomic trends, but investors have also been alarmed by its spending and threats to the company's core social-media business including from other apps such as ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok. On Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg referenced stiff competition, as well as Apple Inc.'s requirement that users opt in to tracking of their devices, which has hurt Meta's ability to target ads. The Journal reported last week that Meta was preparing cuts. Mr. Zuckerberg gave only limited insight in his message on Wednesday into which areas of the company would be reduced, apart from citing recruiting and business teams. People familiar with the matter said the cuts would in part affect staff with overlapping job responsibilities. Managers have been in meetings since Tuesday to discuss the process for laying off employees globally, according to people familiar with the matter. Those laid off will lose access to company systems immediately, and only have access to email until the end of the day, Mr. Zuckerberg said. U.S. staffers that are losing their jobs will receive 16 weeks of severance, plus an additional two weeks for each year of employment at the company, and their stock options set to vest in mid-November will still vest. Meta will cover healthcare costs for those affected and their families for six months, he said. Employees outside the U.S. who are affected will receive similar support, with separate processes related to local employment laws, Mr. Zuckerberg said. Inside Meta, employees have been seeking more information about the layoffs for days. Some have been planning for the worst by forming external groups with current colleagues and discussing how to use benefits. Meta reported more than 87,000 employees at the end of September. Company officials already told employees to cancel nonessential travel beginning this week, the Journal previously reported. Meta's broader cost cutting will ""add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said in his memo Wednesday. He said he would monitor business performance and other factors before deciding how quickly to resume hiring. He also said the company's spending on infrastructure related to artificial intelligence, which can require heaving computer-processing loads, could become more efficient. While smaller on a percentage basis than cuts at Twitter Inc. over the past week that hit about half of that company's staff, the number of Meta employees who are losing jobs appears to be the largest to date at a major tech company. After hiring aggressively through the pandemic, the tech industry is facing its biggest retrenchment in years. Twitter, under new owner Elon Musk, is trying to restructure the company to match his vision, while facing widespread concern from advertisers about its new direction. Snap Inc. said in August it would cut roughly 20% of staff, or more than 1,000 employees, to prepare for what it said would be an expected period of low sales growth lasting into 2023. Business software company Salesforce Inc. also started laying off employees this week. ""Our sales performance process drives accountability. Unfortunately, that can lead to some leaving the business, and we support them through their transition,"" the company said.

Meta_Facebook,Meta's Targeted Ads Face Curbs in Europe --- Privacy regulator's ruling threatens a key source of revenue for Facebook parent,7 December 2022,The Wall Street Journal,"1,014 words",0.9025,0.041,0.023,0.935,"European Union privacy regulators have ruled that Meta Platforms Inc. shouldn't require users to agree to personalized ads based on their online activity, according to people familiar with the decision, a ruling that could limit the data that Meta can access to sell such ads. A board representing all EU privacy regulators approved Monday a series of decisions ruling that EU privacy law doesn't allow Meta platforms, such as Instagram and Facebook, to use their terms of service as a justification for allowing such advertising, the people said. The new EU decisions can be appealed, which could lead to their being suspended pending potentially lengthy litigation. If upheld, though, they could make it harder for Meta and other platforms to show users ads based on what they tap and watch within those platforms' own apps. The company's stock closed down 6.8% Tuesday, as the technology-heavy Nasdaq index dropped 2%. Meta has for years allowed users to opt out of personalizing ads based on data from other websites and apps. But it hasn't given any such option for ads based on data about user activity on its own platforms -- such as which videos an Instagram user watches. If any significant portion of its users opts out of such targeting, Facebook and Instagram would end up with less information with which to build audiences for the personalized ads that analysts and people close to the company say make up the bulk of its revenue. The board's rulings Monday, which haven't yet been disclosed publicly, don't directly order Meta to change practices, but rather call for Ireland's Data Protection Commission to issue public orders that reflect its decisions, along with significant fines, the people added. Ireland is Meta's main privacy regulator in the bloc because it is the site of Meta's European headquarters. Meta will also be able to appeal the Irish decision, as well as the EU decision. ""This is not the final decision, and it is too early to speculate,"" a Meta spokesman said. ""We've engaged fully with the DPC on their inquiries and will continue to engage with them as they finalize their decision."" The company has previously argued that tailoring the ads it sells based on data it has about users' online behavior is a necessary part of the personalized service it offers. It has also said it has options for users to control how it uses their data. A spokesman for Ireland's Data Protection Commission said it would be inappropriate to comment on the content of the decisions. A spokeswoman for the European Data Protection Board, the body representing all EU privacy regulators, confirmed that the board made decisions Monday, but declined to comment on their substance. An eventual decision from the Irish DPC likely wouldn't specify how Meta has to comply. But if the ruling is upheld, it could lead Meta to seek consent from users for targeted ads, or to offer them a chance to opt out. The company declined to say what it might do. Any impact of the decision would come on top of the hit Meta took when Apple Inc. last year required iPhone app developers to ask users whether they want their usage to be tracked. Many iPhone users declined that tracking, cutting off Meta from a significant source of data it used to target ads. The company said the change cut its revenue 8% in 2021. The EU decisions showcase what privacy lawyers describe as a growing willingness by the bloc's regulators to curb what is often called ""behavioral advertising."" That business, worth tens of billions of dollars a year, entails showing users digital ads that are targeted based on profiles and inferences drawn from those users' digital activity. A new privacy law in California also allows users to opt out of what it calls cross-contextual behavioral advertising, said Dominique Shelton Leipzig, partner for cybersecurity and data privacy at Mayer Brown. ""What we're seeing now is a more sharpened approach from regulators toward behavioral tracking,"" Ms. Shelton Leipzig said last month. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation started being enforceable in 2018, and enforcement has ramped up in the past year and a half. Amazon.com Inc. was fined about $786 million last year in Luxembourg for violations related to its advertising, a decision it is appealing. Ireland, for its part, has fined Meta more than $900 million in four other cases in the past 15 months, and it currently has 10 additional inquiries into the company. Meta is still appealing two of those decisions and considering an appeal in the most recent. The company's Irish subsidiary had as of Dec. 31, 2021, allotted nearly 3 billion euros, or about $3.15 billion, for privacy fines in the EU, up by 1.97 billion euros from a year earlier, according to a recent Irish corporate filing. At issue in the Meta decisions is a concept called contractual necessity. The GDPR mostly forbids companies from forcing users to turn over personal information in order to use their services. One exception is when that information is necessary to execute a contract: A food-delivery app needs your home address to deliver that pizza you ordered. Meta decided to rely on that contractual provision of the GDPR when it went into effect in 2018, leading to complaints from Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems. The Irish privacy regulator initially agreed with Meta that the company can use that provision of the GDPR, according to a copy of one of its draft decisions that was leaked last year. But at least 10 EU privacy regulators had objections to its decisions. Their disputes ended up before the European Data Protection Board, of which all EU privacy regulators are members. The board overruled Ireland's position and ordered it to issue dissuasive fines, the people familiar with the decisions said."
Meta_Facebook,EXCHANGE --- Meta's New No. 2 Is Key to Growth Plans --- Javier Olivan emerges as a central player as company's focus shifts to the metaverse,4 June 2022,The Wall Street Journal,754 words,0.9977,0.116,0.004,0.881,"The executive who will succeed Sheryl Sandberg as chief operating officer at Meta Platforms Inc. has quietly but steadily amassed power at the Facebook parent by focusing on growth, one of the business objectives most prized by Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg Javier Olivan, 44 years old, will take on a position very different from that carved out by the high-profile Ms. Sandberg. Mr. Zuckerberg, in naming Mr. Olivan to the new position, said, ""It will be a more traditional COO role where Javi will be focused internally and operationally, building on his strong track record of making our execution more efficient and rigorous."" The transition for Meta's No. 2 spot, due to take place formally in the fall, was announced at a tumultuous time for the company, with the digital-ad market in upheaval from rising inflation, Apple Inc. privacy policies and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Meta in April posted its slowest revenue growth since going public a decade ago. Meta has been trying to adapt and revitalize the advertising juggernaut that Ms. Sandberg created. Mr. Olivan signaled that he would focus on the inner workings of the company to deliver growth and efficiencies. ""One of my biggest priorities will be to ensure that the business products and partnerships sides of our company are in lockstep,"" he said in a Facebook post after his promotion was announced. ""Mr. Olivan will be tasked with reclaiming Meta's ad targeting dominance, likely through tighter integration with platform commerce,"" Jason Helfstein, head of internet research at Oppenheimer, said in a note. Meta declined to make Mr. Olivan available for an interview. The Spanish-born executive joined the social-media platform in 2007 as head of international growth when Facebook was working to expand beyond the U.S. At the time, the company had about $150 million in annual sales, largely in its home country. Meta's revenue last year reached $117.9 billion, with about half generated outside the U.S. Mr. Olivan, with a new M.B.A. from Stanford University, accelerated the expansion. Less than six months after his arrival, Facebook introduced a Spanish-language version of its site. Mr. Olivan told a Spanish news agency at the time that the goal was to ""offer the largest number of languages as soon as possible."" Mr. Olivan then helped Facebook expand into countries such as Brazil, Indonesia and India. By the time the company went public in 2012, Facebook said it was available in more than 70 different languages. ""My first job at Facebook in 2007 was overseeing international growth and expansion,"" he said Wednesday about his new COO role. ""This role gave me a global perspective and reinforced the importance of international voices at Meta. In many ways, this new role brings me back to my roots at the company."" Since joining the company, Mr. Olivan has worked his way up the ranks. He became a direct report to Mr. Zuckerberg by 2014 and went on to build an expanding power structure within the company. A Wall Street Journal analysis published last year of a decade of internal employee lists at Facebook showed that Mr. Olivan's direct reports had grown by more than 900% since 2016, outpacing those of all other executives. At the same time, the number of employees who directly reported to Ms. Sandberg shrank. In 2018, in the midst of a management shake-up, he shifted to a new role as vice president of central products, still with an emphasis on growth. Mr. Olivan was put in charge of shared features that run across Meta's different products and apps, including ads and security spanning Facebook, as well as Instagram and WhatsApp. In January, he secured another promotion, to the position as Meta's chief growth officer. With Mr. Zuckerberg's focus shifting to the metaverse, the online virtual realm that he projects will be so core to Facebook's growth that he renamed the company Meta, Mr. Olivan is emerging once again as a central player. Unlike Ms. Sandberg, who had been noticeably absent from meetings on how to build out the company's metaverse, Mr. Olivan joined Meta's vice president for global affairs, Nick Clegg, in October in announcing 10,000 new jobs being created in the European Union as part of its effort to build the metaverse."
Meta_Facebook,Technology,19 December 2022,The Wall Street Journal Online,660 words,-0.8519,0.051,0.069,0.881,"BRUSSELS—The European Union charged Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. with antitrust violations for allegedly distorting competition by tying its online classified-ad service to its social network. The European Commission, the bloc's antitrust enforcer, on Monday said the U.S. tech company automatically gives Facebook users access to its Marketplace service, potentially pushing aside competing classified-ad services. The commission said it is also concerned that Meta imposes unfair conditions on competing classified-advertising services that use Facebook or Instagram, which is also owned by Meta. The company's terms and conditions authorize Meta to use advertising data from third parties to benefit its Marketplace service, the commission said. The EUfirst opened an investigation into the Marketplace service last year. ""Meta reaches globally billions of monthly users and millions of active advertisers"" through Facebook, said Margrethe Vestager, who leads the bloc's competition enforcement. By tying Facebook to the company's classified-ad service, she said, ""Facebook users have no choice but to have access to Facebook Marketplace."" Meta said it disputes the commission's charges. It said Facebook users that automatically get access to Marketplace are free to decide if they want to use it. The company said Marketplace offers an alternative to large and established e-commerce advertisers such as Amazon.com Inc. and that it doesn't use data from other classified-ad services to compete with them. ""We will continue to work with regulatory authorities to demonstrate that our product innovation is pro-consumer and pro-competitive,"" said Tim Lamb, Meta's head of competition for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The charges against Meta are part of a wave from the EU's antitrust regulators in recent years. The EU last year filed antitrust charges against Apple Inc. for allegedly abusing its control over the distribution of music-streaming apps , including Spotify. It has also opened probes into other companies, including an investigation into allegations that Alphabet Inc.'s Googleabuses its leading role in the digital advertising sector . In the EU, the European Commission has been investigating Meta for years on multiple fronts. Facebook and the commission have squabbled over access to internal documents as part of those investigations. The U.K.'s antitrust watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority, in March separately opened its investigation into whether Meta repurposes the data it gathers from advertisers who buy ads to benefit its own services, including both its marketplace and its dating service. The CMA case is ongoing. Meta will have an opportunity to argue its case before the commission makes a final decision. If the commission concludes the company breached antitrust rules, Meta could face a fine of up to 10% of its global annual revenue. The EU separately on Monday said that it was closing its investigation into whether Meta and Google sought to illegally cooperate in digital advertising, a second time those claims have been dropped, after a U.S. court tossed them out in September. The EU had announced in March it would investigate a deal between the two companies called Jedi Blue, which emerged as part of a lawsuit brought two years ago by a group of U.S. states led by Texas. But a U.S. court in September tossed out the claims pertaining to the ad agreement. On Monday, the European Commission said that it would drop the case because, after collecting evidence from the two companies and the ad tech sector, the regulator ""concluded that the evidence did not confirm its initial concerns."" Google and Meta have disputed the characterization of their deal as potentially anticompetitive. and Sam Schechner at Sam.Schechner@wsj.com EU Charges Meta With Antitrust Violations Linked to Marketplace (""https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-charges-meta-with-antitrust-violations-linked-to-marketplace-11671447845"")"
Meta_Facebook,Meta’s Revamp Gains Urgency,28 July 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,"1,045 words",0.9978,0.111,0.012,0.877,"English , Inc. Mark Zuckerberg’s efforts to remake Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is taking on a new sense of urgency after the company posted its first-ever quarter of falling sales and little sign of an upturn soon. To help stem the decline swiftly, Mr. Zuckerberg is trying to revamp almost every aspect of the social-media platform’s operations, from what content is presented to users, to how digital advertising is delivered, to focusing more on video content. It all adds up to one of the biggest set of changes for the company in years, analysts say. “Meta is at an inflection point—what once seemed untouchable is showing cracks,” said Daniel Newman, a principal analyst at Futurum Research. “Meta has big problems to solve, and like it has done in the past, it needs to be swift to address them all the while dealing with the fiercest competition it has ever faced.” Facebook, as Meta was called before its rebranding last year, has gone through turmoil before. But adding to Mr. Zuckerberg’s challenge is the economic backdrop against which this transformation is playing out. Soaring inflation is weighing on advertising spending and there is stiff competition among platforms for what ad dollars are out there. Ad prices that fell 8% in the first quarter, by Meta’s calculation, were down 14% in the April through June period, the company said Wednesday as it reported quarterly results. A year ago, the company reported an increase of 47% year-over-year for its average price per ad. Mr. Zuckerberg, on an earnings call Wednesday, said “we’re focused on making the long-term investments that will position us to be stronger coming out of this downturn.” The company also faces formidable competition. TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media service surpassed 1 billion monthly active users in September 2021, and its usage surpassed that of Meta’s Instagram among teenagers in November 2021, according to Forrester Research Inc. To battle back, Meta launched Reels—a short-form video service not unlike TikTok’s—for U.S. Instagram users in August 2020. More recently, Mr. Zuckerberg in April said that Facebook and Instagram would more actively use artificial intelligence to recommend content to users from accounts that they don’t already follow. It is a drastic shift away from how Facebook and Instagram have traditionally operated, which is to show content to users from their friends, family or the accounts that they follow. Using an algorithm to determine what content a user is most likely to engage with is perhaps the most signature feature of TikTok. That was followed by an announcement in May from Instagram boss Adam Mosseri, who said that the service would begin testing showing full-screen photos and videos to users, similar to the layout of TikTok’s app. Mr. Zuckerberg said the changes are showing promising early returns. On Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg said that over the past three months Meta saw a 30% increase in the time that users are engaging with Reels. He added that nearly one in six posts in users’ Instagram and Facebook feeds come from accounts that users don’t follow and are based on AI recommendations. That figure will rise to one in every three posts by the end of 2023, he said. “I think we’re on track here and we just need to push through this one,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. But the changes have also created a popular revolt among some high-profile users. This week more than 2 million Instagram users liked a post that reads “Make InstagramInstagram Again” and “stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends.” Among the users who shared the post were influential celebrities Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian. “I need to be honest. I do believe that more of Instagram is going to become video over time,” Mr. Mosseri said Tuesday. Mr. Zuckerberg addressed the backlash on the earnings call, saying that users will still see content from their friends but insisting that the changes will improve Facebook and Instagram. The social media giant has navigated rough patches before. As it prepared to go public in 2012, Facebook, then still largely accessed on PCs, faced Wall Street questions about how it would deal with the consumers shifting to mobile. The company responded by buying up Instagram for $1 billion and revamping its mobile apps. Facebook found itself in a similar quagmire in 2016 when it was locked in a fierce rivalry with Snap Inc., the maker of Snapchat. The company responded by launching Instagram Stories, a rival to its competitor’s most notable feature. Mr. Zuckerberg will be pursuing the latest transformation without one of his closest compatriots. Sheryl Sandberg, who is credited with helping build Facebook into the ad juggernaut it became, is leaving the company and was on her last Meta earnings call Wednesday. Meta also is trying to push through changes while undergoing belt tightening. The company cut its forecast for expenses this year to a range of $85 billion to $88 billion, from an earlier projection of $87 billion to $92 billion. The company also will reduce its rate of hiring, he said, with some teams shrinking. “This is a period that demands more intensity, and I expect us to get more done with fewer resources,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. The co-founder last year unveiled new plans for the company as he renamed it Meta, principally around a push to embrace the so-called metaverse, a nascent, more immersive vision of the internet where people would interact. “I still believe that these projects are important, but given the more recent revenue trajectory that we’re seeing, we’re slowing the pace of these investments and pushing some expenses that would have come in the next year or two off to a somewhat longer timeline,” he said on the earnings call. “Previously challenging periods have been transformational for our company and helped us develop our next generation of leaders, and I expect this period to be no different,” Mr. Zuckerberg said.

Meta_Facebook,Facebook’s Shift to Metaverse Expected to Eat Into Profits,2 February 2022,Dow Jones Institutional News,767 words,0.9913,0.082,0.022,0.896,"English , Inc. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is expected to post rising revenues but a modest decline in profit as it ramps up spending to execute the pivot to the metaverse as outlined late last year by Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg. In its first quarterly earnings since changing its name in October, Meta will also break out its Reality Labs segment, which will offer investors insight into the health of the virtual and augmented reality consumer business unit that is at the heart of the metaverse efforts. The name change was part of a bold strategic shift from Mr. Zuckerberg to bet the company’s future on VR headsets, AR glasses and virtual worlds, known as the metaverse, in which users can live and work. Although this will be the first time Meta breaks out its Reality Labs segment, the company is expected to report relatively small revenue for the business unit. While Reality Labs represents the company’s vision moving forward, the Facebook and Instagram advertising business remain the core part of Meta’s revenue streams. For the quarter, advertising is expected to represent nearly 98% of the company’s revenue, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. Analysts predict Meta’s advertising revenue will rise to $32.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, up 19.9% compared with the year-earlier period. The company is expected to report a $10.9 billion profit for the fourth quarter, down more than 2% compared with a year prior, according to FactSet. This would be Meta’s first decline in net income growth since the second quarter of 2019. The earnings are set to be released after markets close on Wednesday following a rough January for U.S. equities. It was the worst month for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite since March 2020 as investors consider how rising interest rates could weigh on the tech sector’s pricey valuations. Shares of Meta fell more than 7% in January alone, extending a more than 16% slide since the company closed at a record high on Sept. 7 through its close on Tuesday. “We got to be watching for things like how sensitive advertising businesses are to price increases and inflation,” said Daniel Newman, principal analyst at Futurum Research, which focuses on digital technology. “How robust is Facebook in an inflationary environment? Can they continue to raise prices even if the economy slows?” If Google parent Alphabet Inc. is any indicator, Meta’s advertising business should be just fine. Alphabet on Tuesday reported its fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue up 32% year-over-year to $75.3 billion for the period. As part of the breakout of the company’s VR and AR business, Meta will provide historical information for the segment, showing investors how the business has grown over the previous five quarters and the past three fiscal years. Of keen interest to investors will be how sales of the company’s Quest 2 VR headset fared during the 2021 holiday shopping season. Upon announcing the name change in October, Mr. Zuckerberg said that the company expected “to invest many billions of dollars for years to come before the metaverse reaches scale.” “Savvy investors know that new directions denote new spending—and since the metaverse isn’t well defined, I think they are expecting [Meta] to spend a ton of money,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer of investment firm Bokeh Capital. “But first movers are not guaranteed success—just ask Myspace.” The strategic turn comes as the company continues to increase its user base. Last month, CNBC reported that Instagram had reached 2 billion monthly active users, a 100% increase since June 2018. The latest earnings come as Meta continues to face criticism from lawmakers and users over revelations in The Wall Street Journal’s “Facebook Files” series, which showed that the company knows that its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm. Those articles spurred congressional hearings, prompted a rebuke from Facebook’s own oversight board and led the company to halt work on a version of its Instagram app focused on children. The company has also endured a series of executive departures in recent months. Most notably, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer, head of Facebook’s cryptocurrency efforts David Marcus and the head of the company’s Messenger unit Stan Chudnovskyall announced their departures from the company in the last four months of 2021.

Meta_Facebook,Business/Financial Desk; SECTB,10 October 2022,The New York Times,"2,001 words",0.9777,0.076,0.042,0.882,"1 English .  Meta's push to develop virtual and augmented reality technology has had a bumpy year. Last October, when Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, announced that the company would change its name to Meta and become a ''metaverse company,'' he sketched a vision of a utopian future many years off in which billions of people would inhabit immersive digital environments for hours on end, working, socializing and playing games inside virtual and augmented worlds. In the year since, Meta has spent billions of dollars and assigned thousands of employees to make Mr. Zuckerberg's dream feasible. But Meta's metaverse efforts have had a rocky start. The company's flagship virtual-reality game, Horizon Worlds, remains buggy and unpopular, leading Meta to put in place a ''quality lockdown'' for the rest of the year while it retools the app. Some Meta employees have complained about frequent strategy shifts that seem tied to Mr. Zuckerberg's whims rather than a cohesive plan. And Meta executives have butted heads over the company's metaverse strategy, with one senior leader complaining that the amount of money the company had spent on unproven projects made him ''sick to my stomach.'' The company's struggle to reshape the business was described in interviews with more than a dozen current and former Meta employees and internal communications obtained by The New York Times. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about internal matters. On Tuesday, Meta is expected to unveil a new V.R. headset at a developer conference, along with other new metaverse features. The stakes are high for the company, which is racing to transform itself to make up for declines in other parts of its business. TikTok is siphoning younger users away from Facebook and Instagram, Meta's two big moneymakers, and Apple made privacy changes to its mobile operating system that have cost Meta billions of dollars in advertising revenue. The company's stock price has tumbled nearly 60 percent in the past year -- a reflection not just of broader market turbulence, but of some investors' skepticism that the metaverse will be highly lucrative anytime soon. In late September, the company announced that it would freeze most hiring, and Mr. Zuckerberg has warned employees that layoffs may be coming. ''The pressures Meta's business is facing in 2022 are acute, significant and not metaverse-related,'' said Matthew Ball, an investor and metaverse expert whose advice Mr. Zuckerberg has sought. ''And there is a risk that almost everything Mark has outlined about the metaverse is right, except the timing is farther out than he imagined.'' In a statement, Andy Stone, a Meta spokesman, said the company believed it was still on the right path. ''Being a cynic about new and innovative technology is easy,'' Mr. Stone said. ''Actually building it is a lot harder -- but that's what we're doing because we believe the metaverse is the future of computing.'' Mr. Zuckerberg successfully overhauled his company a decade ago, getting it to focus on how its products worked on smartphones instead of desktops. He signaled a similar shift last year, saying that investing in the metaverse would allow Meta to make the leap from one technological era to the next. There are some signs that Meta's bet has put it ahead of competitors. The company's consumer V.R. headset, the Quest 2, is the most popular V.R. headset on the market with more than 15 million sold, according to outside estimates. Its Oculus V.R. app -- which has since been rebranded Meta Quest -- has been installed over 21 million times on iOS and Android devices, according to an estimate by Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. But Meta's future success depends on the company's ability to bring virtual and augmented reality tools to far more people. Meta said in February that its Horizon Worlds game had grown to roughly 300,000 monthly active users -- an increase from a few months earlier, but minuscule in comparison with Facebook's more than 2.9 billion monthly active users. The company declined to provide more up-to-date figures for Horizon Worlds. Adding to Meta's woes is that U.S. regulators appear determined to prevent the company from acquiring its way to success, as it did by buying Instagram and WhatsApp. In July, the Federal Trade Commission sued Meta to block it from acquiring Within, the maker of a popular V.R. fitness app. Meta is fighting the agency's lawsuit, which it has called ''wrong on the facts and the law.'' Mr. Zuckerberg, determined to recast his public image after years in the limelight for unpopular decisions about political speech on Facebook, has surprised some employees by making himself the innovator face of the company's metaverse push. Demonstrations and mock-ups of Meta's latest metaverse technologies feature footage of Mr. Zuckerberg performing V.R. versions of his hobbies, including fencing and a surfing-like watersport called hydrofoiling. The chief executive recently went on Joe Rogan's podcast, where he told the popular comedian that building an immersive metaverse was his ''holy grail.'' His involvement has backfired at times. In August, Mr. Zuckerberg posted a screenshot of his Horizon Worlds avatar on his Facebook page, along with an announcement that the app was expanding into France and Spain. But the avatar's flat, cartoonish look was roundly mocked. (One commenter compared it to ''a 2002 Nintendo GameCube release.'') After that response, Mr. Zuckerberg and other executives directed employees to give priority to improving the appearance of avatars, according to two employees. Mr. Stone, the Facebook spokesman, characterized Mr. Zuckerberg's reaction to the avatar backlash as ''frustrated,'' but did not provide additional details. A new version of Mr. Zuckerberg's digital appearance was fast-tracked, the two employees said, along with updates to other Horizon Worlds avatars that had been in the works. Four days after Mr. Zuckerberg's original post, he shared that upgraded digital version of himself, conceding that his first avatar was ''pretty basic'' while the ''graphics in Horizon are capable of much more.'' One Meta graphic artist claimed in a LinkedIn post, which has since been deleted, that he and his team had designed roughly 40 versions of Mr. Zuckerberg's face over a four-week period before a final version was approved. Mr. Zuckerberg's zeal for the metaverse has been met with skepticism by some Meta employees. This year, he urged teams to hold meetings inside Meta's Horizon Workrooms app, which allows users to gather in virtual conference rooms. But many employees didn't own V.R. headsets or hadn't set them up yet, and had to scramble to buy and register devices before managers caught on, according to one person with knowledge of the events. In a May poll of 1,000 Meta employees conducted by Blind, an anonymous professional social network, only 58 percent said they understood the company's metaverse strategy. Employees have also grumbled about the high turnover and frequent shuffling of employees as Mr. Zuckerberg's priorities change. Inside Meta, two employees said, some workers now jokingly refer to key metaverse projects as M.M.H., an acronym for ''make Mark happy.'' In September, Vishal Shah, the vice president in charge of Meta's metaverse division, wrote on an internal message board that he was disappointed in how few Meta employees were using Horizon Worlds, according to a post obtained by The Times. In his post, which was first reported by The Verge, Mr. Shah said that managers would begin tracking workers' use of Horizon Worlds, and said that testing their own technology was essential. ''Why don't we love the product we've built so much that we use it all the time?'' Mr. Shah asked. ''The simple truth is, if we don't love it, how can we expect our users to love it?'' Mr. Shah, who declined to comment to The Times, also said in his post that Horizon would undergo a ''quality lockdown'' for the rest of the year to ''raise the overall craft and delight of our product.'' As Meta has struggled to grow its metaverse, some at the company have suggested unconventional ideas for bringing in new users. This summer, three Meta employees proposed marketing V.R. headsets to Americans who received student debt relief from the Biden administration, believing it could boost sales of headsets by 20 percent, according to an internal post viewed by The Times. ''This is an opportunity for Meta Quest growth, as there is evidence that past Federal Stimulus spurred growth,'' the analysis read. It does not appear that the company acted on the advice. One prominent insider who has objected to Mr. Zuckerberg's approach to the metaverse is John Carmack, a well-known game developer and former chief technology officer of Oculus, the V.R. company Facebook acquired for roughly $2 billion in 2014. He continues to work part time at Meta as an adviser. In a podcast interview in August, Mr. Carmack said the scale of Meta's metaverse bet -- last year, it reported a $10 billion loss in the division housing its A.R. and V.R. units -- made him ''sick to my stomach thinking about that much money being spent.'' He added that Meta's development of the metaverse has been hampered by big-company bureaucracy and concerns about issues like diversity and privacy. Mr. Carmack has also spoken out on Workplace, Meta's internal message board. In posts obtained by The Times, Mr. Carmack, who is speaking at the developer conference on Tuesday, criticized features of the company's V.R. headsets, calling the need to run software updates before using them ''extremely bad for user enjoyment.'' Mr. Carmack did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Carmack's criticism has put him at odds with executives like Andrew Bosworth, Meta's chief technology officer, who oversaw the company's V.R. efforts for years and is a close ally of Mr. Zuckerberg's. Mr. Carmack, according to four employees who have worked with him, has urged the company to think about the metaverse primarily from the immediate user experience, while Mr. Bosworth has approached it from a longer-term point of view with a focus on business opportunities. As the pressure grows, Mr. Zuckerberg has sent a clear message to Meta employees: Get on board or get out. In a June meeting first reported by Reuters, the 38-year-old billionaire noted that ''there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn't be here'' and that he'd be ''turning up the heat'' on expectations and goals, according to copies of his comments that were shared with The Times. Since then, the company has frozen most hiring, reduced budgets and Mr. Zuckerberg asked managers to start identifying low-performing employees. Faced with possible layoffs, some Meta employees have started to convey more enthusiasm for the metaverse. More teams have been conducting meetings inside Horizon Workrooms in recent months, several employees said. But the transition has been rocky. Earlier this year, Mr. Bosworth tried to lead a staff meeting inside Horizon Workrooms, according to an employee who was present. The meeting was thwarted by technical glitches and the team ended up using Zoom, the employee said. Mark Zuckerberg introducing the Oculus Quest virtual-reality headset in 2019.

Meta_Facebook,"The Facebook Files: Facebook Can Hurt Work, Families, Its Research Shows --- Internal documents say 12.5% of users struggled to manage time on the app, which they saw as worse than other social media",6 November 2021,The Wall Street Journal,"2,185 words",-0.9756,0.062,0.09,0.848,"[Latest in a series] Facebook researchers have found that 1 in 8 of its users report engaging in compulsive use of social media that impacts their sleep, work, parenting or relationships, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. These patterns of what the company calls problematic use mirror what is popularly known as internet addiction. They were perceived by users to be worse on Facebook than any other major social-media platform, which all seek to keep users coming back, the documents show. A Facebook team focused on user well-being suggested a range of fixes, and the company implemented some, building in optional features to encourage breaks from social media and to dial back the notifications that can serve as a lure to bring people back to the platform. Facebook shut down the team in late 2019. A company spokeswoman said Facebook in recent months has begun formulating a new effort to address what it calls problematic use alongside other well-being concerns, such as body image and mental health. The company has been public about its desire to address these problems, said Dani Lever, the spokeswoman, in a statement. Some people have struggles with other technologies, including television and smartphones, she said. ""We have a role to play, which is why we've built tools and controls to help people manage when and how they use our services,"" she said in the statement. ""Furthermore, we have a dedicated team working across our platforms to better understand these issues and ensure people are using our apps in ways that are meaningful to them."" The Wall Street Journal's Facebook Files series has documented how Facebook knows the products and systems central to its business success routinely fail and cause harm. For some people, such as teen girls or human-trafficking victims, the risks can be significant. These documents highlight the company's research into possible negative impacts on a broader swath of users. The research was launched several years ago with the goal of mitigating harmful behavior that the company was increasingly identifying on its platforms. The researchers on the well-being team said some users lack control over the time they spend on Facebook and have problems in their lives as a result. They wrote that they don't consider the behavior to be a clinical addiction because it doesn't affect the brain in the same way as gambling or substance abuse. In one document, they noted that ""activities like shopping, sex and Facebook use, when repetitive and excessive, may cause problems for some people."" Those problems, according to the documents, include a loss of productivity when people stop completing tasks in their lives to check Facebook frequently, a loss of sleep when they stay up late scrolling through the app and the degradation of in-person relationships when people replace time together with time online. In some cases, ""parents focused more on FB than caring for or bonding with their children,"" the researchers wrote. ""I'm on Facebook every day, every moment. Literally, every moment; just not when I'm in the shower,"" a 22-year-old woman told the researchers. ""I lose the notion of time."" In March 2020, several months after the well-being team was dissolved, researchers who had been on the team shared a slide deck internally with some of the findings and encouraged other teams to pick up the work. The researchers estimated these issues affect about 12.5% of the flagship app's more than 2.9 billion users, or more than 360 million people. About 10% of users in the U.S., one of Facebook's most lucrative markets, exhibit this behavior. In the Philippines and in India, which is the company's largest market, the employees put the figure higher, at around 25%. The researchers said in the documents that most of the people who use Facebook compulsively said they used multiple social-media apps, including Instagram and WhatsApp, which are also owned by Meta Platforms Inc., Facebook's new corporate parent, along with Twitter and Snapchat. Some of the troublesome aspects for users on Facebook are also widespread in smartphone use, the researchers noted. ""Why should we care?"" the researchers wrote in the slide deck. ""People perceive the impact. In a comparative study with competitors, people perceived lower well-being and higher problematic use on Facebook compared to any other service."" The other services in the comparison also included YouTube, Reddit and the videogame ""World of Warcraft."" The researchers noted the results couldn't determine causality. They said they would need to conduct more studies to determine whether, for example, Facebook causes people to have problems sleeping, or if people who have trouble sleeping experience higher stress and turn to Facebook as a distraction. Facebook's findings are consistent with what many external researchers have observed for years, said Brian Primack, a professor of public health and medicine and dean of the College of Education and Health Professions at the University of Arkansas. He said there isn't a consensus on causality but that most of the evidence ""should be concerning to people."" His research group followed about a thousand people over six months in a nationally representative survey and found that the amount of social media that a person used was the No. 1 predictor of the variables they measured for who became depressed. In late 2017, a Facebook executive and a researcher wrote a public blog post that outlined some of the issues with social-media addiction. According to the post, the company had found that while passive consumption of social media could make you feel worse, the opposite was true of more active social-media use. ""Actively interacting with people -- especially sharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions -- is linked to improvements in well-being,"" the company said. Facebook then made a switch to more heavily weigh ""meaningful social interactions"" in its news feed as a way to combat passive consumption. One side effect of that change, as outlined in a previous Journal article in The Facebook Files, was that the company's algorithms rewarded content that was angry or sensational, because those posts increased engagement from users. Facebook said any algorithm can promote objectionable or harmful content and that the company is doing its best to mitigate the problem. Laurin Manning Gandy, 40, signed up for Facebook in late 2004, and the media strategist said the platform enabled her to reach people beyond her own immediate network. Ms. Gandy said she would check her posts again and again, counting how many comments and likes had rolled in, often spending eight hours or more a day on the app. ""Every second that I wasn't occupied by something I had to do I was fooling around on my phone scrolling through Facebook,"" Ms. Gandy said. ""Facebook took over my brain."" Ms. Gandy says she realized she had abandoned her creative pursuits, including drawing and painting, in exchange for a purely online existence. She increasingly came to see it as an addiction. In 2018, Facebook added a time-management tool to the app. It includes a dashboard where users can see their total time on the app each day and set a daily reminder to give themselves an alert when they have reached the amount of time they want to spend on it. Inside Facebook, the researchers registered concern about the direction of Facebook's focus on certain metrics, including the number of times a person logs into the app. ""One of the worries with using sessions as a north star is we want to be extra careful not to game them by creating bad experiences for vulnerable populations,"" a researcher wrote, referring to elements designed to draw people back to Facebook frequently, such as push notifications. In 2018, then Facebook board member Reed Hastings, who co-founded Netflix Inc., told top Facebook executives he wasn't sure why the company needed to apologize for being heavily used, according to three people familiar with the matter.Mr. Hastings added that he wouldn't apologize for allowing people to binge-watch shows on Netflix, the people said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Hastings declined to comment. The well-being team, according to people familiar with the matter, was reshuffled at least twice since late 2017 before it was disbanded, and could get only about half of the resources the team requested. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has said the company continues to prioritize the issue. ""We certainly do not want our products to be addictive,"" he said in a November 2020 Senate hearing in response to a question from Sen. Lindsey Graham. ""I don't think the research has been conclusive, but it is an area that we care about and study,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said. In 2018, Facebook's researchers surveyed 20,000 U.S. users and paired their answers with data about their behavior on Facebook. The researchers found about 3% of these users said they experienced ""serious problems"" in their sleep, work or relationships related to their time on Facebook that they found difficult to change. Some of the researchers' work was published in a 2019 paper. According to that study, the researchers also said that a liberal interpretation of the results would be that 14% of respondents spent ""a lot more time on Facebook than they want to,"" although they didn't label this group problematic users. People who felt like they have a problem with the app were more likely to be men; either teens or in their 20s; have about 15 more sessions a day than the average user; and spend a greater portion of their time on the app at night. They also spent more time on Facebook overall -- about 1 hour and 36 minutes a day, compared with 1 hour and 18 minutes a day for regular users. Some of the people, although they reported problems, also said the time they spend on Facebook is more valuable than people who don't report problems. In 2019, the researchers had come to a new figure: What they called problematic use affects 12.5% of people on Facebook, they said. This survey used a broader definition for the issue, including users who reported negative results on key aspects of their life as well as feelings of guilt or a loss of control, according to the documents. The researchers also wrote that they had a more detailed understanding of the aspects of Facebook that triggered the issues, which they said include getting too many notifications, videos that play automatically, uncertainty over whether they will see posts from the people they want to follow and ephemeral content that users felt compelled to watch before it disappeared, among others. Facebook provided a related research the Journal that described the rationale for the broader metric. ""There is no established or consistently used definition of internet addiction or problematic use in academic research or clinical practice,"" the researchers wrote, calling the work an effort to rethink industry approaches to problem behaviors. In mid-2019, the researchers held a workshop to come up with ways to change Facebook to address the concerns of people who said their use of the app caused problems in their lives. The most-liked fixes included alerts to remind users to take a break from Facebook, a way to dial back the notifications people receive and a wind-down mode to tell Facebook to not show certain types of content before bed, such as politics. Tom Meitner, a 36-year-old self-published crime novelist in Milwaukee, used a tool designed by an outside developer called Unfollow Everything to remove the scroll of posts in his newsfeed. Before he did that, he said Facebook took too much of his energy and left him feeling crabby. He has a wife and three young children, and said he aims to bring positive energy to his family life at the end of each day. But the more time he spent arguing with people on Facebook, the harder that became. ""I'd log on and it was just loaded with these ideas and opinions,"" he said. ""It became a situation where I might post something in response to someone, and suddenly I'm having an argument with someone's uncle whom I'd never met."" Mr. Meitner said he considered quitting Facebook but was conflicted because he appreciated how the app connected him with friends and family who no longer lived in his area. And he sometimes used Facebook to advertise his novels. ""Unfollowing everything allowed me to take stock of who is taking my energy, where does my brain power belong, and if I'm going to engage with certain people,"" Mr. Meitner said. --- John West contributed to this article."
