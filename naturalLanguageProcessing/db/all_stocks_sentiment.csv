Meta_1Month,Tech,23 May 2018,WSJ Pro Cybersecurity,"1,209 words",-0.9812,0.06,0.093,0.847,"English , Inc. BRUSSELS—Mark Zuckerberg apologized to European Union lawmakers over the fake-news and privacy scandals engulfing Facebook Inc., but rebuffed suggestions that the company has outsize market power and avoided responding to many difficult questions. Speaking at a hearing at the European Parliament Tuesday on how the social network handles Europeans' data, Facebook's CEO echoed his recent testimony before U.S. Congress on similar issues. ""We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility—that was a mistake and I'm sorry for it,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said. ""I'm committed to getting this right."" European lawmakers pressed him on the steps the company has taken since the revelations that data-analytics firm Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained the personal information of as many as 87 million Facebook users. They also questioned Mr. Zuckerberg over the spread of fake news on the Facebook platform, the company's market power and how the social network will comply with the EU's new privacy law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation , which enters into force Friday. Some Parliament members fumed that the format of the hearing didn't allow the CEO to directly respond to all questions posed to him. As is typical of most European Parliament hearings, Mr. Zuckerberg grouped his responses after all lawmakers spoke. He didn't respond to questions over whether the social network would ever allow users to opt out of targeted advertising, and whether he thought it was morally correct to collect data on people who don't use Facebook. British Conservative member Syed Kamall described the process as a ""get out of jail free card"" because it gave Mr. Zuckerberg ""too much room to avoid the difficult questions."" Mr. Zuckerberg pledged to follow up on any unanswered questions in writing over the following days and said the company would soon send an executive for a more extensive hearing. During his U.S. congressional testimony on April 10 and 11, Mr. Zuckerberg repeatedly made similar pledges to provide follow-up responses to questions he couldn't answer. A Facebook spokesman said Tuesday it was still working on those responses. European Parliament President Antonio Tajani said the format of Tuesday's hearing was his idea. Other members were dissatisfied with the substance of Mr. Zuckerberg's responses. Speaking to reporters after the hearing, German leftist Gabriele Zimmer called them ""very general answers."" Jan Philipp Albrecht, the German member of Parliament from the Green Party who led the GDPR negotiations, told reporters: ""I am shocked that Zuckerberg didn't take this seriously at all."" In response to questions about the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook has more tightly restricted the data that outside apps can access and has suspended 200 apps it suspects of having misused user data shared on or through Facebook. He said the company is reviewing thousands more apps and expects more to be removed. He also said Facebook is working to more broadly protect the integrity of elections, including by encouraging voters to go to the polls and by working with governments to identify misinformation threats in real time. The issue is of interest to Parliament members, who face elections next spring. Mr. Zuckerberg also stressed Facebook's commitment to Europe, announcing that it would hire an additional 3,000 employees in the region to reach a total of 10,000 by the end of the year. Seated around a hoop-shaped table in an intimate wood-paneled room in the European Parliament, roughly a dozen European lawmakers individually interrogated the chief executive. Manfred Weber, the leader of the largest group in the European Parliament, the European People's Party, said more regulation for the company was needed and raised the issue of Facebook's market dominance. ""We should discuss breaking up the Facebook monopoly. Can you convince me not to do so?"" Liberal member Guy Verhofstadt also dug into the question of the company's market power, stressing that self-regulation wouldn't be enough to control the company. ""We have a big problem here,"" he said, asking Mr. Zuckerberg to decide whether he wants to be remembered ""in fact as a genius who created a digital monster that is destroying our democracies and our societies."" In response, Mr. Zuckerberg said the company ""exists in a very competitive space, where people use a lot of different tools for communication"" adding that advertisers have ""a lot of choice"" in terms of where they choose to advertise. The hearing comes amid greater scrutiny of tech giants by authorities and regulators around the world, who are increasingly looking to Europe for direction on how to rein in the Silicon Valley firms over their privacy policies, market power, tax payments and other issues. The GDPR, the EU's new privacy law, is one such piece of legislation. Mr. Zuckerberg said the company would be compliant with the new rules by Friday, adding that a large portion of European users already reviewed and consented to the new privacy policies designed to meet the demands of the new law. Brussels is the first stop for Mr. Zuckerberg as he seeks to calm tensions with European officials. On Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg will travel to Paris, where he will attend a government-organized lunch with executives from Uber Technologies Inc., Microsoft Corp. and other firms about using technology to promote the common good, and Thursday he will speak at a tech conference. In Paris, Mr. Zuckerberg will have a private meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. ""No subject will be avoided,"" an official at the French presidential palace said of the meeting with Mr. Zuckerberg. ""The president is very direct."" EU and European national regulators for years have been among the most active world-wide in trying to bridle Facebook. A working group of several EU data-protection watchdogs brought sanctions against the company for prior changes to its privacy policies, though some of those decisions were thrown out in court. Some EU regulators are also investigating the company's use of data about users of chat app WhatsApp, which it bought in 2014 for $22 billion. Persuading Mr. Zuckerberg to speak was a victory for the 751-member parliament, which is the EU's most democratic institution but wields little power. Facebook has so far spurned a similar invitation from the U.K. parliament. Mr. Zuckerberg had initially agreed to answer questions in a closed-door meeting. That sparked outrage from many EU politicians and commentators, prompting the parliament to negotiate an agreement to webcast the event.

Meta_1Month,Business,11 May 2018,WSJ Pro Cybersecurity,"1,106 words",0.9859,0.073,0.033,0.893,"English , Inc. A pizza shop needs your address to deliver your pizza. A chat app service needs your selfie if you want to send it to friends. But do internet giants like Facebook and Google really need a list of websites you recently visited? A battle is looming in Europe over what information Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and other companies can demand from you. It boils down to what they really need to know—a debate that could get stuck in courts for years with the potential to weaken either the European Union's new data-privacy law or the business models of ad-reliant giants like Facebook and Google. The EU's new privacy law , which goes into effect on May 25, forbids companies from forcing users to turn over personal information as a condition of using their services. Does that mean you can simply say, ""No, thanks,"" to any data collection and still use Facebook? Not exactly. There are many exceptions in which companies can still collect data, such as when that information is necessary to fulfill a contract with you. That has set the stage in Europe for a battle over what is truly necessary, and when consent is ""freely given,"" regulators and privacy lawyers say. ""The crux of this argument is going to be the legitimacy of the behavioral advertising business model,"" said Omer Tene, vice president and chief knowledge officer for the International Association of Privacy Professionals. ""Behavioral advertising"" is the name for the business, worth tens of billions of dollars a year, that allows companies to show users targeted advertising based on their internet activity. In recent weeks, Facebook has continued work to comply with the new European law—called the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR—in part by asking users in the EU to opt in to being shown targeted advertising that draws on data gathered from their activity, such as web browsing or purchasing information. But when it comes to authorizing Facebook to collect that data, the company now gives users a stark choice: agree to its new terms of service or delete their accounts. ""If you don't accept these, you can't continue to use Facebook,"" a pop-up says of the company's terms and conditions. Facebook says the data it collects is necessary to fulfill its contract with users to provide ""a personalized experience."" The company says it offers prominent options to control how that data is used, but that as a data-driven business, it needs to collect information about its users to function. ""There are certain elements of the service which are core to providing it and which people can't opt out of entirely, like ads,"" said Stephen Deadman, Facebook's global deputy chief privacy officer. ""There's no point in buying a car and then saying you want it without the wheels. You can choose different kinds of wheels, but you need wheels."" Several regulators, including Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner—the lead privacy regulator in Europe for Facebook because that is where the company has its base in the EU—say they are digging into the decision by companies like Facebook to rely on contractual necessity to justify the collection or processing of some data under GDPR. A spokesman for the Irish agency, which is headed by Helen Dixon, said it is ""unlikely"" that contractual necessity would pass muster for ""collection and processing of personal data arising from tracking off-platform""—that is, on sites or apps other than those belonging to a particular service provider. ""What is really necessary for the performance of the contract between the users and Facebook?"" asked Johannes Caspar, the privacy regulator for the city of Hamburg, Germany. That is ""one of the crucial questions which we will have to answer under the GDPR."" he said. Google, for its part, issued a new privacy policy on Friday that outlines how the company collects data about users, including location and data from other apps and sites that use Google services. The company has added new controls, such as the ability to mute an ad that is following a user across the web, and has reorganized existing controls to turn off features like personalized ads. But it isn't possible to opt out of all data collection by the site. In the policy, Google justifies much of that data collection under another rationale in GDPR called ""legitimate interest."" Companies' use of that justification is also likely to spark legal scrutiny, lawyers and privacy experts say. Google on Friday said that it has been working on its compliance with GDPR for 18 months, and has implemented processes to review protections in new products, adding ""we'll continue to improve our Privacy Program and the protections we offer to users."" Verizon Communications Inc.'s Oath, which includes Yahoo and AOL, says that with its new European privacy policy if users withdraw their consent to collecting their data—including web-browsing habits or location data—that they ""may not have access to all (or any) of our services."" ""Processing of your information for the purposes of personalized content and ads is a necessary part of the services we provide,"" the policy explains. A spokesman for Oath declined to comment. Privacy-rights advocacy groups plan to raise this issue, among others, once GDPR goes into effect. The new law gives consumer groups the ability to lodge collective complaints, akin to class-action lawsuits, before privacy regulators or national courts. France's La Quadrature du Net, a digital-rights advocacy group, says that it is readying a series of complaints against large tech companies on the question of whether consent is freely given . Noyb, another privacy advocacy group founded by privacy activist Max Schrems, is raising money specifically for the purpose of filing complaints under the law. ""There will be many, many situations where someone will say, ‘My consent isn't free,' and the service provider will say, ‘But you accepted the terms and conditions,'"" said Eduardo Ustaran, a privacy lawyer for Hogan Lovells. ""All of these legal concepts will be scrutinized to death for years to come.""

Meta_1Month,International Business Machines Corporation; Patent Issued for Self-Aware and Self-Healing Computing System (USPTO 9971652),25 May 2018,Investment Weekly News,"1,646 words",-0.9161,0.077,0.077,0.846,"English © Copyright 2018 Investment Weekly News via VerticalNews.com 2018 JUN 2 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Investment Weekly News -- International Business Machines Corporation (Armonk, NY) has been issued patent number 9971652, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by VerticalNews editors. The patent's inventor is Gangadhar, Deepak K. (Bangalore, IN). This patent was filed on May 8, 2015 and was published online on May 15, 2018. From the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: ""Computing systems have become increasingly complex, yet are increasingly relied upon to perform mission-critical functions. As a result, when a computing system fails, significant money can be lost until the computing system is restored. However, complex and sophisticated systems can take a long time to restore, even when a large number of programmers and developers are dispatched to restore them. Therefore, there is a need within the prior art for computing systems that are self-aware, such that they can detect when they have failed or are about to fail, and for computing systems that are self-healing, such that they can restore themselves."" Supplementing the background information on this patent, VerticalNews reporters also obtained the inventor's summary information for this patent: ""The present invention relates to self-aware and self-healing autonomic computing systems. A method of the invention organizes microstates of components of a computing system into macrostates of the computing system, and organizes the macrostates into meta-dynamic states (MDS's) of the computing system. The computing system is capable of being in different macrostates when in a given MDS, but remains dynamically invariant when in the given MDS regardless of which macrostate the computing system is in. The MDS's are organized into desirable MDS's, undesirable MDS's, and transient MDS's. Desirable and undesirable MDS's are stable, whereas transient MDS's are unstable, and are the transient states in which the computing system enters on the way to a desirable or an undesirable MDS. ""In response to the computing system being perturbed, the method determines whether the computing system will enter or has entered a given undesirable MDS. If the computing system will enter or has entered a desirable MDS, nothing may be done in one embodiment of the invention, since the computing system itself will stabilize to the desirable MDS, if it has not already done so already. However, if the computing system will enter or has entered an undesirable MDS, then the method constructs a microstate/MDS graph (MMG) that depicts which meta-dynamic states the computing system enters when microstates of the computing system are changed. The microstates are changed according to a number of parameters, including the maximum number of components that may be forced to have a microstate change at any given time, the cost associated with each microstate change, and the time limit for how long movement of the computing system to a desired MDS is to take. ""Next, the method constructs a self-heal graph (SHG) from the MMG. The given undesirable MDS is at the center of the SHG, and the nodes at the periphery of the SHG are part of the desired MDS. The SHG thus has paths from the given undesirable MDS to the desired MDS, where each path has an associated cost that is incurred for the computing system to move along the path. The method selects an optimal path from the paths leading from the given undesirable MDS to the desired MDS, which have the lowest associated costs. The method finally causes the computing system to move on the optimal path selected so that the computing system reaches the desired MDS. The methods of the present invention may each be implemented as a computer program stored on a computer-readable storage medium of an article of manufacture and executed by the computing system. The computer-readable storage medium may be a recordable data storage medium of the computing system. ""In one embodiment, the computer program performs a method comprising: ""organizing a plurality of microstates of a plurality of components of a computing system into a plurality of macrostates of the computing system; ""organizing the macrostates of the computing system into a plurality of meta-dynamic states of the computing system; ""organizing the meta-dynamic states into a plurality of desirable meta-dynamic states, a plurality of undesirable meta-dynamic states, and a plurality of transient meta-dynamic states; ""in response to the computing system being perturbed, where the computing system will enter or has entered a given undesirable meta-dynamic state, constructing a microstate/meta-dynamic state graph that depicts which of the meta-dynamic states the computing system enters when one or more of the microstates are changed according to a maximum number of components that the computing system is able to force a microstate change on, a cost associated with each microstate change, and a time limit for how long movement of the computing system to a desired meta-dynamic state is able to maximally take; ""constructing a self-heal graph from the microstate/meta-dynamic state graph, such that the given undesirable meta-dynamic state is at a center of the self-heal graph, and the desired meta-dynamic state is at a periphery of the self-heal graph, the self-heal graph having a plurality of paths from the given undesirable meta-dynamic state to the desired meta-dynamic state, each path having an associated cost that is incurred for the computing system to move along the path; ""selecting an optimal path from the paths from the given undesirable meta-dynamic state to the desired meta-dynamic state that have lowest associated costs; and ""causing the computing system to move on the optimal path selected to the desired meta-dynamic state. ""In a given embodiment, the computing system comprises: a first component to monitor the computing system to detect perturbations of the computing system resulting in movement thereof to new meta-dynamic states, and to determine whether the new meta-dynamic states are undesirable; and a second component to cause the computing system to move along paths to desired meta-dynamic states where the first component has determined that the new meta-dynamic states are undesirable, wherein the computing system comprises a plurality of components, each component having a plurality of microstates organized into a plurality of macrostates of the target computing system, the macrostates organized into a plurality of meta-dynamic states. ""In the given embodiment, the computing system may be capable of being in different macrostates when in a given meta-dynamic state, but remains dynamically invariant when in the given meta-dynamic state regardless of which macrostate the target computing system is in. The second component may be configured to construct a microstate/meta-dynamic state graph depicting which of the meta-dynamic states the target computing system enters when one or more of the microstates have been changed according to one or more parameters. The second component may be further configured to construct a self-heal graph from the microstate/meta-dynamic state graph, such that an undesirable meta-dynamic state is at a center of the self-heal graph, and a desired meta-dynamic state is at a periphery of the self-heal graph. The computing system may be an autonomic computing system. ""A computing system of the invention includes two components. The first component monitors a target computing system, which may be the same or a different computing system than the computing system having the two components, to detect perturbations of the computing system that result in movement of the target computing system to new MDS's. The first component further determines whether the new MDS's are undesirable or desirable. The second component causes the target computing system to move along paths to desired MDS's, where the first component has determined that the new MDS's are undesirable. The target computing system itself includes a number of components, where each component has a number of microstates organized into a number of macrostates, and where the macrostates are organized into MDS's. ""Embodiments of the invention provide for advantages over the prior art. An autonomic computing system of the invention is self-aware, in that it is able to determine whether an MDS into which it has been perturbed is desirable or undesirable. The autonomic computing system is further self-healing, because if it determines that the MDS into which it is perturbed is undesirable, the computing system can perform a corrective action. Specifically, the computing system determines an optimal path from the undesirable MDS to a desired, desirable MDS, and causes itself to move along this path. ""Embodiments of the invention impart the homeostatic behavior of the human autonomic nervous system (ANS), which allows the human body to achieve self-awareness and self-healing, into computing systems, making them autonomic in turn. That is, embodiments of the invention artificially simulate the homeostasis found in the human body, to achieve autonomic computing systems. Still other advantages, aspects, and embodiments of the invention will become apparent by reading the detailed description that follows, and by referring to the accompanying drawings.""

Meta_1Month,"Patent Application; ""Method and System for Managing Communications in a System Comprising a Receiver Entity, a Sender Entity, and a Network Entity"" in Patent Application Approval Process (USPTO 20180109503)",8 May 2018,Information Technology Newsweekly,"2,119 words",0.8556,0.044,0.027,0.929,"English © Copyright 2018 Information Technology Newsweekly via VerticalNews.com 2018 MAY 8 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Information Technology Newsweekly -- A patent application by the inventors Nadas, Szilveszter (Budapest, HU); Mihaly, Attila (Dunakeszi, HU), filed on April 28, 2015, was made available online on April 26, 2018, according to news reporting originating from Washington, D.C., by VerticalNews correspondents. This patent application has not been assigned to a company or institution. The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""There are currently a few trends in networking. One relates to the privacy of communication. Accelerated by the recent pervasive monitoring attempts revealed, more and more traffic is sent end-to-end encrypted. One relevant example is the recently finalized HTTP2.0 protocol (second major version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol) in IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), which assumes de facto encryption using TLS (Transport Layer Security) over TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). Similarly, the recently proposed next-generation transport protocol for web by Google, QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections), also assumes end-to-end encryption. ""Another change relates to the multiplexing of traffic. In the case of best-effort handling at the bottleneck, traffic multiplexing between the same endpoints allows for resource sharing that is more aligned with the QoE-needs (QoE stands for Quality of Experience) of the different streams sharing the same connection. This is why HTTP2.0 also uses the multiplexing paradigm. Similarly, QUIC is also based on the multiplexing paradigm. Another example is WebRTC which multiplexes audio, video streams and potential file transfers onto the same UDP connection. WebRTC is a free, open project that provides browsers and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs. ""A typical network architecture comprises the presence of network entities, of which later described middleboxes are an example, which are interposed between the nodes. Middleboxes are used for a number of reasons, including implementing acceptable use policies, maintaining regulatory compliance, thwarting attacks, censoring or monitoring users, expanding address space, limiting or balancing resources. ""In an all-encrypted, multiplexed world some communication to network middleboxes will still be needed. Middleboxes could have different roles. For example, they may act as Policy Decision Points: they may select domain specific QoS (Quality of Service) solution of flows/packets based on traffic identification, flow states and/or packet handling information. Traditionally in case of broadband traffic DPI/SPI (Deep Packet Inspection/Shallow Packet Inspection) boxes perform this role, but DPI/SPI (Deep Packet Inspection/Shallow Packet Inspection) methods are hardly applicable for encrypted and multiplexed traffic. Signaling based solutions have not gained acceptance due to deployment complexity. They may provide information about the network path, e.g. maximum achievable bitrate, minimum delay, etc. to aid path selection, i.e. to help end-point decide which access to use. They may send advisory messages to applications to help adaptation. Examples for such advisory messages are to provide an initial congestion window or advise up/down-stepping the QoE level in case of adaptive media, based on the congestion status of the network. They may provide transport protocol enhancement in several layers. They may optimize FEC (Forward Error Correction) and retransmission. In general, middleboxes may apply specific treatments to the packets when forwarding those packets to the network nodes, noting that packet treatment includes, but is not limited to, any notorious packet treatment as described for instance in RFC 2474, RFC4221, RFC2598, RFC3260. ""All the above roles and functions require some kind of meta-information exchange between the end-points and middleboxes, mostly about traffic characteristics information. Such meta-information refers to information that enables the middlebox to apply a specific treatment to the packet, as also later explained in more detail. ""The present invention relates to meta-information reveal by the traffic sender using for instance the same connection, i.e., in-band meta-information reveal by sender. This is a feasible and advantageous, and sometimes unique alternative to other signaling methods. For example, in case of traffic multiplexing, the information revealed may change from packet to packet in a connection. For example, if the endpoints request different traffic treatment for the voice traffic, video traffic and data traffic for a WebRTC connection, then it should be possible for the middlebox to identify the packets belonging to the different streams. This requires some kind of additional packet markings to the middlebox, because the set of five different values that comprise a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) connection (5-tuple) is the same for all the packets. ""In some cases, even for a single stream per connection the information to reveal may change from packet to packet, which would require frequent signaling updates if not solved by meta-information including for instance some type of packet markings. In the case of SVC (Scalable Video Coding) videos, for example, the QoS treatment desired may differ depending on which QoS layer a given packet carries. ""Another advantage of in-band meta-information reveal is that is always on-path, i.e., the information is attached to the traffic. That is, no problems may arise e.g., due to re-routing (due to e.g., hand-avers) or multi-path delivery. ""There are existing methods for in-band meta-information reveal, e.g., by marking the DiffServ Codepoints (DSCP, RFC4594) in the IP packet headers (DiffServ or differentiated services is a computer networking architecture that specifies a simple, scalable and coarse-grained mechanism for classifying and managing network traffic and providing QoS on modern IP networks). However, DiffServ markings are un-encrypted and their usage has been limited to a single-domain, because of the fact that these fields may be easily modified across network domains. ""There are different methods to send end-to-end encrypted data between two endpoints. With reference to FIG. 7, the commonly accepted methods use three different pieces of information for encoding: the information to encode 710 (showed as 'plain text' in the figure); the encryption key(s) 730; an initialization vector 720 (IV). By means of an encoding algorithm 700, the encoded or cyphered information 740 is obtained. ""An initialization vector is a nonce used for data encryption. In this context, 'nonce' stands for 'number used once' or 'number once'. The initialization vector, used only once in any session or connection, prevents repetition of sequences in encrypted text. Identifying such repetitions can help an attacker break a cipher. The initialization vectors or related algorithms and random numbers may be exchanged between the parties during security context setup, but there are algorithms for which the nonce must be unique, but predictability of the initialization vector is acceptable, and may therefore be a simple counter e.g., some unique packet sequence numbers may be used as initialization vector. ""The decryption of the encrypted end-to-end data is then the opposite process using some keys and the same initialization vector, shown in FIG. 8. Accordingly, the encoded or cyphered text 710, the IV 820 and the key(s) 830 are used for the decoding (or deciphering) algorithm 800 in order to obtain the deciphered information 840 corresponding to the information 740 of FIG. 7. ""It further becomes desirable applying encryption to the meta-information, as this enhances security. For instance, such encryption reduces the risk that the treatment of packets is altered by network nodes that, by getting knowledge of the meta-information, may apply them differently and/or to other packets such that the packets forwarding may not anymore be as intended or desired. Within this context, it has been found that merely encrypting the meta-information at the sender may not be free from problems. It thus becomes necessary finding a suitable way for safely handling meta-information, and to avoid prior art problems related to the handling of meta-information. It is thus an object to provide an improved handling of meta-information."" In addition to the background information obtained for this patent application, VerticalNews journalists also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent application: ""The object is achieved by the subject-matter of the independent claims. Advantageous embodiments are defined in the dependent claims. Further examples are provided for facilitating the understanding of the invention.

Meta_1Month,Business,16 May 2018,WSJ Pro Cybersecurity,640 words,0.6705,0.051,0.04,0.909,"English , Inc. BRUSSELS—Facebook Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and other European officials next week, as the Silicon Valley giant tries to calm tension with regulators and policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic. Mr. Zuckerberg will meet with top European lawmakers in Brussels to discuss the social network's handling of its users' personal information, and its potential impact on European elections, said European Parliament President Antonio Tajani. The hearing won't be open to the public, an EU official said. In Paris, Mr. Zuckerberg will participate in a lunchtime meeting next Wednesday at France's Elysee Palace called ""Tech for Good"" that will include such tech executives as Uber Technologies Inc. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, a French official said. Mr. Zuckerberg will also have a private meeting directly with Mr. Macron, the official added. ""We are looking forward to meeting next week with the president of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron,"" the company said, adding of its meetings with EU lawmakers: ""We … appreciate the opportunity for dialogue, to listen to their views and show the steps we are taking to better protect people's privacy."" A Facebook spokesman declined to comment when asked if Mr. Zuckerberg would travel to other European capitals or meet with other officials. Facebook has come under fire in recent months over revelations that the social network allowed personal information of as many as 87 million users to be obtained by data-analytics company Cambridge Analytica. Facebook also has faced heat over interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by Russian operatives using the social network . Ahead of European Parliament elections in 2019, the EU has been pushing platforms to do more to halt the spread of misinformation or ""fake news,"" on their sites, or face possible regulation. Mr. Macron has also directed his government to work on proposing a law to rein in fake news during election periods. Some EU lawmakers criticized the decision to hold the meeting in Brussels behind closed doors. ""Given the deep mistrust caused by the Cambridge Analytica scandal, this meeting must be public. There should not be double standards for the U.S. Congress and the European Parliament,"" said Green group leaders Philippe Lamberts and Ska Keller. A trip by Mr. Zuckerberg next week would coincide with the bloc's sweeping new privacy laws , which enter into force next Friday, May 25. Facebook has said it would implement some privacy controls inspired by the law world-wide. While smaller advertising rivals and analysts say the law could favor the company's advertising business because Facebook will have an easier time getting consent, the company also faces scrutiny from regulators and privacy activists over whether it gathers more information than it needs. European lawmakers have stepped up calls for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify in Brussels about the Cambridge revelations after he spoke before U.S. lawmakers in mid-April . In the U.K., a British parliamentary committee requested Mr. Zuckerberg testify about Facebook's handling of user data or face a formal summons. Facebook has said Mr. Zuckerberg had no plans to go to the U.K., and a spokesman Wednesday said he had ""nothing else to add right now."" The company sent a top executive to testify before the committee last month. In January, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg also met with Mr. Macron in Paris, and with EU officials in Brussels.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  Austin startup Meta SaaS, which was backed by billionaire Dallas businessman Mark Cuban, has been acquired by an Illinois software maker. Financial terms of the purchase by software and security manager Flexera, based in Itasca, Ill., were not disclosed. Founded two years ago, Meta SaaS helps companies better manage their software-as-a-service subscriptions, or ""SaaS."" Meta SaaS says it saves customers money by identifying underutilized services, which accumulate as companies shift to the cloud. The company tracks a customer's SaaS activity and alerts it to any underutilized service or upcoming contract renewal. Auto-renewals alone can cost companies up to $10 million a year, Meta SaaS says. Cuban led a $1.5 million investment in Meta SaaS last May. Additional investors included Barracuda Networks and Austin software industry veteran Brett Hurt. Meta SaaS was not the first Austin investment for Cuban, who is a businessman, investor and owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks. He is also a backer of The Zebra, an Austin startup that lets consumers compare car insurance rates online. Tom Canning, vice president of strategy at Flexera, said the acquisition of Meta SaaS will allow its customers to identify more than 32,000 SaaS applications and manage contract renewals through automatically generated reports. ""The number of SaaS apps is skyrocketing - especially among small and medium-size companies. As much as a third of those applications aren't even being used,"" he said. ""Because companies can't see or manage SaaS apps in use across the enterprise, cost and risk are out of control."" Flexera offers services for managing IT assets and overall cloud and software security. The company is changing the Meta SaaS name to Flexera SaaS Manager. Contact Lori Hawkins at 512-912-5955.

News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a system and method for video game skill level adjustment and video game handicapping. ""When video game users play a new video game for the first time, they may each start at a same skill level or a same level of difficulty. For example, all users may start playing a new video game at a first level and then proceed sequentially through each successive level as a prior level is traversed. Similarly, in a multi-player gaming format, a player that is new to a game may start at a relatively low skill level, regardless of prior experience with similar games. Thus, a mismatch may exist between a starting level in a new game and the likely skill level of the new user with regard to the new game. Additionally, in a multi-player format game, there may be a mismatch between the new user and the other players that the new user is matched against with regard to the relative skill in playing the new game. ""Some video games incorporate handicapping systems to even the playing field between players playing in single or multiple player format games. However, such handicapping systems may include a calibration period in which the user plays the new game for a relatively long period of time prior to determining the user's relative skill level with regard to the difficulty of the game, or the skills of other players playing the game.

Meta_1Month,monkey-cage,25 May 2018,Washington Post.com,"1,087 words",0.9931,0.111,0.065,0.823,"Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  On Friday, the European Union's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) privacy regulation goes into effect. Many articles have been written complaining that the regulation is ambiguous, confusing and difficult to implement. These articles are right up to a point, but they miss the bigger picture. The GDPR is not just a set of rules. It is a set of political opportunities actors are battling to take advantage of to make sure that the ambiguities are interpreted in their favor rather than someone else's. Already, one of the major new battles is becoming clear. Facebook has accepted the GDPR but has deliberately interpreted it in a minimalist way. Privacy activist Max Schrems and his new organization NOYB (None of Your Business) have used the GDPR to launch four major court cases against Facebook and its subsidiaries. If Schrems's interpretation prevails, Facebook's business model will be fundamentally challenged. Facebook has accepted GDPR … but only up to a point. Over the past several months, Facebook has gotten a lot of terrible publicity. Russian ""influence operations"" may or may not have had much influence, but they were able to make liberal use of Facebook to circulate memes and try to widen divisions in the U.S. public. Cambridge Analytica used Facebook data to target millions of American voters. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has embarked on a publicity tour to try to stanch the blood loss. One of his major talking points has been that Facebook takes privacy seriously — and is demonstrating its seriousness by adhering to the European Union's GDPR. Zuckerberg has even talked of extending GDPR protections to customers in the United States. However, Facebook's commitment to GDPR is more limited than some of its public statements suggest. Facebook is going to apply only some GDPR protections worldwide. It has also changed its terms of service for 1.5 billion customers outside Europe and the United States, who used to have a relationship with Facebook's European headquarters in Dublin, presumably to make sure that the GDPR does not apply to them. Finally, it has interpreted GDPR in a way that critics describe as minimalist, for example requiring customers to consent to Facebook's data collection practices if they are to use Facebook at all. This has given its critics a target. As soon as the GDPR went into effect, Schrems brought four cases under its new provisions. Three of these actions have been taken against Facebook and Facebook subsidiaries, and one has been taken against Google Android. Schrems is an Austrian activist who has been a thorn in Facebook's side for a long time. He started by using E.U. privacy law to demand that Facebook provide the information that it held on him. He then went on to make a case against Facebook's use of an E.U.-U.S. privacy agreement, the Safe Harbor, which resulted in the European Court of Justice taking down the entire agreement (we discuss how this happened in our forthcoming 2019 book with Princeton University Press). Schrems already has another case against Facebook that threatens to invalidate the successor agreement to Safe Harbor, as well as another means that Facebook and other companies have used to try to transport data across the Atlantic. [This explains how social media can both weaken — and strengthen — democracy] Schrems is arguing that Facebook cannot require European users to consent to Facebook's data practices as a condition of doing business with Facebook. The data that Facebook collects isn't necessarily being used to provide services to customers. Instead, data is being used to provide services to advertisers — allowing Facebook to connect customers with particular characteristics and belonging to particular demographics to people who want to advertise specific goods and services. Schrems's case is a dagger aimed at the heart of Facebook's business model. If Schrems's case succeeds, Facebook's business model is in serious trouble. Facebook runs what economists call a ""two-sided market."" Facebook users are not Facebook customers — they are Facebook's product. They are served up to the real customers — the advertisers who use Facebook — in precisely calculated slices. If, to take a hypothetical example, you want to advertise to men who are interested in guns and have strong conservative beliefs in the Birmingham, Ala., metropolitan region, Facebook can probably help ensure that your ads appear on their feeds. Schrems's case looks to drive a wedge between the services that Facebook provides to its users and the services that it provides to its real customers. He is arguing that the data that Facebook collects is often not relevant to providing the services from which Facebook users benefit, and hence they should not be required to sign up to these services. Facebook has always maintained that the services it provides to its users, and the services that it provides to its advertising customers, are inseparable. If Schrems succeeds in convincing regulators and courts that the two need to be separated, then Facebook and other e-commerce companies face an extraordinarily difficult choice. Either they abandon Europe or they radically change their business model. GDPR is only the start of the story. What this tells us is that the introduction of new rules is not the end of the story but is usually its beginning (again, we develop this argument at much greater length in our forthcoming book on privacy battles). Ambiguities in rules lead to battles between political actors about how those ambiguities should be interpreted. Facebook has tried to interpret the ambiguities in one way. Now it is facing an existential challenge from Schrems, who is interpreting the new rules very differently and taking full advantage of their possibilities. If Facebook wants to avoid radical change, it is going to have to convince privacy regulators (many of whom are already skeptical about Facebook) and European courts (which have been quite activist on privacy issues over the past several years) that its minimalist interpretation of the GDPR is acceptable.

Meta_1Month,Zuckerberg pledges to 'keep building' in no-apology address,2 May 2018,Associated Press Newswires,"1,302 words",0.9934,0.099,0.033,0.867,"English (c) 2018. The Associated Press.  SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — With a smile that suggested the hard part of an ""intense year"" may be behind him, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed developers Tuesday and pledged the company will build its way out of its worst-ever privacy debacle. It was a clear and deliberate turning point for a company that's been hunkered down since mid-March. For first time in several weeks, Zuckerberg went before a public audience and didn't apologize for the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a political data-mining firm accessed data from as many as 87 million Facebook accounts for the purpose of influencing elections. Or for a deluge of fake news and Russian election interference. Instead, Zuckerberg sought to project a ""we're all in this together"" mood that was markedly different from his demeanor during 10 hours of congressional testimony just a few weeks ago. His presentation also marked a major change for the company, which seems relieved to be largely done with the damage control that has preoccupied it for the past six weeks. On Tuesday, speaking in San Jose, California, at the F8 gathering of software developers, Zuckerberg said to cheers that the company is re-opening app reviews, the process that gets new and updated apps on its services, which Facebook had shut down in late March as a result of the privacy scandal. Zuckerberg then vowed to ""keep building,"" and reiterated that Facebook is investing a lot in security and in strengthening its systems so they can't be exploited to meddle with elections, including the U.S. midterms later this year. The company had previously announced almost all of those measures. ""The hardest decision I made wasn't to invest in safety and security,"" Zuckerberg said. ""The hard part was figuring out how to move forward on everything else we need to do too."" He also unveiled a new feature that gives users the ability to clear their browsing history from the platform, much the same way people can do in web browsers. Then Zuckerberg returned to techno-enthusiasm mode. Facebook executives trotted out fun features, most notably a new dating service aimed at building ""meaningful, long-term relationships,"" in a swipe at sites like Tinder. After Facebook announced its entry into the online dating game, shares of Tinder owner Match Group Inc. plummeted 22 percent. Poking fun at himself, Zuckerberg unveiled a ""Watch Party"" feature that gives users the ability to watch video together — such as, he suggested, ""your friend testifying before Congress."" Up flashed video of Zuckerberg's own turn on Capitol Hill. ""Let's not do that again soon,"" he said. Zuckerberg did ""remarkably well in a really rough environment,"" said Ben Parr, co-founder of Octane AI, a startup that helps companies market their wares on Facebook's Messenger app. ""I think it helped a lot that he was joking, he was confident and he was comfortable."" Facebook's next actions will speak far louder than anything Zuckerberg during his 35-minute presentation Tuesday, predicted Cubeyou CEO Federico Treu, who is battling Facebook over what he believes was the unjustified suspension of his company app in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. ""Developers are going to be the type who say, 'You spoke about a lot of things, but we will wait and see,'"" Treu said. Zuckerberg won over the crowd again when he announced that the thousands of people in attendance would get Facebook's latest virtual reality headset — the portable, $199 Oculus Go — for free. ""Thank you!"" someone yelled to Zuckerberg from the audience. Zuckerberg also went out of his way to thank Jan Koum, the co-founder and CEO of messaging platform WhatsApp, who announced his departure Tuesday. Facebook paid $19.3 billion for WhatsApp in 2014. Despite reports that Koum left over concerns about how Facebook handles private data , Zuckerberg described him warmly as ""a tireless advocate for privacy and encryption."" Some analysts said Zuckerberg's performance bolsters his chances of navigating the company out of its privacy scandal and overcoming concerns that it can't handle its fake-news and election problems. By leading off with Facebook's security and privacy responsibilities, then continuing to extend Facebook's ambitions to connect people in new ways, Zuckerberg successfully ""walked the tightrope,"" said Geoff Blaber, vice president of research and market analysis firm CCS Insight. ""F8 felt like the first time Facebook has been on the front foot since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke,"" Blaber said. Emarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said it seemed like Facebook was ""able to strike the right chord"" with developers; she figured some might respond to Zuckerberg with boos and heckles, although none seemed to. She was surprised that the event wasn't more subdued with fewer gee-whiz announcements — and definitely didn't expect a dating service. ___ Ortutay reported from New York and Nakashima reported from San Francisco.

Meta_1Month,Facebook Inc Annual Shareholders Meeting - Final,31 May 2018,CQ FD Disclosure,"14,819 words",0.9756,0.053,0.012,0.935,"© 2018 by CQ-Roll Call, Inc.  Presentation DAVID KLING, VP, DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL & CORPORATE SECRETARY, FACEBOOK, INC.: Good morning. Welcome. Thanks for joining us for Facebook's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. I am Dave Kling, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of Facebook and Chairman of this annual meeting, which I now call to order. Let me run through today's agenda. First, we'll focus on the formal business set forth in the proxy statement. Then, Mark will spend a few minutes talking about how Facebook has been doing. And finally, we'll conclude with a Q&A session. Before we begin with the formal business, I'd like to remind you to please turn off all mobile devices and of the rules of conduct that were provided to you when you entered the meeting, including the rule prohibiting photos and recording of any kind. Thanks for your cooperation. Let me start by introducing the members of our Board of Directors who are here today: Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Erskine Bowles, Ken Chenault and Sue Desmond-Hellman. I would also like to introduce 2 other people who are in attendance: Alex Bender of Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm; and Kris Veaco, who will act as the Inspector of Election for this meeting and who will tabulate the results of the voting. Ms. Veaco has previously executed the oath of Inspector of Election. Turning now to the formal business. I have a copy of the notice, together with the declaration as to the mailing, of the proxy statement made available to all Facebook stockholders of record as of April 6, 2018. I also have a list of stockholders entitled to vote at this meeting, which is available for inspection by any stockholder present or by any proxy holder who is representing a stockholder and which list will be filed with records of the meeting. I'm advised by the Inspector of Election that the holders of shares representing at least the majority of the voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock voting together as a single class are present or represented by proxy here today, and the requisite quorum to conduct business is therefore present. Accordingly, this meeting is authorized to transact the business set forth in our proxy statement. We have 8 proposals to consider at this meeting, each of which is described in the proxy statement. We'll discuss these proposals momentarily. First, however, I will remind you that, today, voting is by proxy and written ballot. If you've already sent in a proxy, you do not need -- and do not intend to change your vote, there is no need for you to cast a ballot today. Your vote will be counted automatically without any further action on your part. However, any stockholder present who has not turned in a proxy or who wishes to change their vote may cast a ballot at this meeting. Does any stockholder wish to cast a ballot today? Great. If so, raise your hand, and one of our volunteers will bring one to you. Okay. It is currently 11:06, and the polls are now open. You may vote at any time during our discussion of the proposals on the agenda. Once you filled out your ballot, please raise your hand in the air, and our volunteers will come and collect it. I will now review the proposals to be voted on at this meeting. The first item of business is to elect our Board of Directors to serve until our next annual meeting or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. The director-nominees are: Marc Andreessen, Erskine Bowles, Kenneth Chenault, Susan Desmond-Hellmann, Reed Hastings, Sheryl Sandberg, Peter Thiel and Mark Zuckerberg. The qualifications of each proposed director are set forth in the proxy statement. No other director-nominees have been properly submitted for election pursuant to our bylaws or SEC rules. Therefore, no other nominations may be accepted at this time. The Board of Directors recommends a vote for the election of each of the nominated directors. The second item of business is to ratify the... UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible) I'd like to urge shareholders to vote against the election of Mark Zuckerberg as the chair of the Board of Directors under (inaudible) Facebook... DAVID KLING: Thank you, miss. We're actually not doing question and answer right now. UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible) agenda Item #1, the election of directors... DAVID KLING: I understand. But if you can please sit down. We're actually going to run through the proposals and the proponent for each proposal. I can make statements right now. UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So I will be allowed to make a statement on Item 1? DAVID KLING: There is going to be -- there will be a Q&A session at the end. UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: But then people who have voted (inaudible) now. DAVID KLING: I understand, but we haven't structured the meeting that way. If you could please sit down. UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: This is the one day of the year that shareholders are allowed to face the Board of Directors (inaudible) and speak to each other and shareholders (inaudible) is already laughing at Facebook for this. DAVID KLING: Yes, please. I'm sorry. It's -- we structured the meeting to run through each of the proposals, and we also want to give each of the shareholder proponent the time to speak. There will be a Q&A session at the end after Mark makes his remarks, and we'll have management on the stage, and we do welcome everyone to ask questions or make statements at that time. The second item of business is to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. The Board of Directors recommends a vote for this proposal. Finally, we've received 6 stockholder proposals that complied with the requirements of our bylaws and SEC rules and, therefore, are eligible to be voted on at this meeting. The Board of Directors recommends a vote against each of proposals 3 through 8. Each stockholder proponent may now make a statement in support of their proposal. I will call you up one by one to one of the microphones. Please limit your statements to no more than 3 minutes. First, for Proposal 3, which is the proposal regarding a change in stockholder voting, Christine Jantz will be speaking on behalf of NorthStar Asset Management. Ms. Jantz? Oh, my gosh. CHRISTINE JOANN JANTZ, CIO, NORTHSTAR ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC.: Good morning. My name is Christine Jantz from NorthStar Asset Management of Boston, beneficial owner of 37,758 shares of Facebook common stock. Fellow shareholders, I am here to represent resolution #3, a good governance proposal about equal voting rights. This proposal has never been as crucial as this year given the highly concerning issues our company is currently facing. As shareholders, we do not like reading news that states, ""Facebook believes that the data of up to 87 million people was improperly shared with a political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica."" So if privacy is a human right, as stated by Microsoft's CEO, then we contend that Facebook's poor stewardship of customer data is tantamount to a human rights violation. We must remember that, as of last week, the EU General Data Protection Regulation went into effect, which will clearly affect Facebook's business in Europe. Government regulation is necessary, but it is not sufficient when management fails. Facebook's management and board have consistently minimized our input as shareholders by reducing our voting rights. The Cambridge Analytica scandal is an egregious example of when a board is formed by a CEO to meet his needs, primarily insiders or other affiliated people rather than truly independent directors who will provide proper management oversight to protect shareholder investment. Given the existing share structure, the current status of shareholder outrage against the company board can have no corrective action. Despite the fact that board member Peter Thiel is directly connected to Cambridge Analytica, it's mathematically impossible for non-entitled shareholders to vote down Mr. Thiel's nomination. Shareholders cannot even assume that management will take action when it sees an overwhelmingly high vote by others and insiders against a management proposal or board member as evidenced by our company's attempt to create a third class of stock despite outsider common shareholders' vote against it in 2016. Soon, you will hear a shareholder proposal about risk oversight committee, an issue that is clearly vital to our company right now. But even if every single outside shareholder vote is in favor of that proposal, it will still fail if Mr. Zuckerberg votes against it. We are at a vital impasse for our company. We are faced right now with a situation for which Facebook clearly does not have the expertise to manage. Yet, if these crucial governance proposals fail, shareholders will have no assurance that management will be held accountable or the critical issues will be addressed. My firm and our colleagues have been bringing this issue to Facebook shareholders for years, and clearly, the recent scandals exemplify the need for the shareholder rights overhaul. Shareholders, we urge you to vote for proxy item #3. DAVID KLING: Great. Thank you. Next, for Proposal 4, which is proposal regarding a risk oversight committee, William Lana will be speaking on behalf of Trillium Asset Management. Mr. Lana? WILL J. LANA, PARTNER & INVESTMENT MANAGER, TRILLIUM ASSET MANAGEMENT LLC: Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the board, fellow shareholders. My name is Will Lana, and I'm here on behalf of Trillium Asset Management and Park Foundation to hereby move item #4, seeking a report discussing the merits of establishing a risk oversight board committee. Facebook could benefit from putting into place a board committee structure to meet the unique challenges and demands it faces. It is not necessary or helpful to read off a list of controversies facing Facebook. We all know what that list looks like. We have identified at least 15 distinct controversies. Suffice to say, the list is long, and the list is serious. Accordingly, the risk that the company and its shareholders face are profound and real. It is evident to us that Facebook's piggybacking of risk oversight onto the audit committee no matter how well utilized is not up to the task. The purpose of the audit committee is to focus on financial reporting processes, not on big-picture risk oversight. The board statement on the proposal says the audit committee has, ""The appropriate time and resources to oversee risk exposure."" But we must ask ourselves, if the audit committee does have the time and resources to oversee these issues, why is the list of controversies confronting Facebook so long and so serious? The proof of the current structure's inadequacy is on display in the daily headlines. It's worth noting that the lack of a board risk committee is just one of several signs that risk oversight is downplayed on Facebook's board. For example, conspicuously absent from lengthy corporate governance guidelines published to Facebook's website is any mention of risk. The board -- bios for the directors also do not mention risk, nor does any director have explicit risk management expertise. Being put forward today is a commonsense fix to prioritize risk, an approach The Conference Board and Harvard Law School Forum generally considered good governance. ISS, the proxy adviser service, recommending a vote in favor of Item 4 calls our request reasonable, acknowledging the sheer volume of Facebook's controversies and observing that, ""Shareholders would benefit from more information about proactive steps the board has taken to reform its risk management process to ensure the company is proactively assessing and mitigating risks."" I think it is apparent to everyone that 2018 is a pivotal year for Facebook. Considerable money and resources have been diverted to multiple efforts that address a litany of problems. This is all well and good. But to be effective, these reactive measures must be paired with a proactive improvement to Facebook's fundamental risk oversight. Let us not miss this opportunity to make a simple yet a powerful change that will go a long way towards laying a foundation for a successful future, a successful future not only for the company and its shareholders, but for Facebook's users and communities around the world. Thank you for your time and attention and for your support of Item 4. DAVID KLING: Thank you. Next, for Proposal 5, a proposal regarding a simple majority vote, [James McRitchie] will be speaking on behalf of the proposal. UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Super majority requirements are used to block initiatives supported by most shareholders, but opposed by board seeking entrenchment. Most S&P 500 and even S&P 1500 companies have no super majority requirements. Mark Zuckerberg and associates own 89% of Class B shares or 60% of total voting power. However, a provision of the charter specifies that when class B common shares represent less than a majority of total voting power, bylaw will still require at least 2/3 of the voting power of the company. Therefore, even if those shares are sold off or converted as requested by NorthStar's Proposal #3, super majority vote requirements could still impede shareholder action. A simple majority standard will give shareholders an equal and fair representation in the company by limiting the power of shareholders who own a large stake. Facebook is clearly a trendsetting company with tremendous influence over our nation, as evidenced by the most recent presidential election. Will our country be increasingly headquartered to corporate dictatorships? Will corporate dictatorships support a strong, democratic government in here, in these United States of America? Or will they continue to seek short-term power and profits for the few at the expense of conditions that favor the long-term broader interests of all their shareholders and users? How shareholders -- how shares are voted today at Facebook on NorthStar's Proposal #3 to recapitalize the company and our Proposal #5 to move to a simple majority vote could send a clear message. Even if its votes were strictly tied to its economic stake, Mr. Zuckerberg and other class B shareholders would still wield considerable power. Turning around corporate governance at Facebook could dramatically enhance the reputation of our company and Mr. Zuckerberg as well as providing a higher probability that cumbersome regulations can be minimized. George Washington was encouraged to continue as president for life, but stepped down for the good of the country. Mr. Zuckerberg could take a page from history, emulate George Washington, not Vladimir Putin. Vote for Proposals #3 and 5 make Facebook more democratic and accountable. DAVID KLING: Thank you. Next, for Proposal 6, a proposal regarding a content governance report, Natasha Lamb will speak on behalf of Arjuna Capital. Miss Lamb? NATASHA L. LAMB, MANAGING PARTNER AND MD, ARJUNA CAPITAL, LLC: Good morning. Thank you. I just want to note that I think it was inappropriate, the woman who spoke originally. [Ms. Lindsay] was -- her microphone was taken away, and she was escorted out of the meeting. I don't think she was that disruptive. My name is Natasha Lamb. I'm here to move Proposal #6 on behalf of Arjuna Capital and co-filers, including the New York State Common Retirement Fund and the Illinois State Treasurer. We're asking our company to publish a report on corporate content governance. From political subterfuge, fake news, hate speech and sexual harassment, it is clear that content that violates Facebook's own terms of service poses a risk to the company's market value and brand. Last year, at this very meeting, we highlighted the risk posed by fake news propagated over the platform. And while our board opposed reporting, we learned 6 months later and only through congressional testimony that 126 million Americans may have viewed Russian propaganda prior to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Four months later, we learned that 87 million Americans' data was compromised by Cambridge Analytica with the intent to manipulate users for political gain. In the wake of that scandal, Facebook's market value dropped nearly $100 billion. And while today's proposal is broader, I'm surprised to see a similar reaction from our board, a recommendation to vote against greater transparency and accountability to investors. Fines and regulation by governments, lost advertising revenue and a soured brand may further impact investment returns. In fact, users may leave the social media platform if they feel its content lacks integrity. A recent poll indicates fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws. And proxy adviser, ISS, has noted the company's failure to protect its users' privacy has eroded the level of trust among users, calling into question the company's business model and its governance. Turning to the era of MeToo and TIME'S UP, Facebook has not adequately addressed the role of social media in perpetuating sexual harassment. According to Pew, 8 in 10 young women believe online sexual harassment is a major problem. And Facebook's platform has been criticized for sexual harassment policies that failed to protect women. Facebook's ability to proactively assess its content governance, reporting mechanisms and enforcement capabilities will inform how successfully the social platform will navigate a complex landscape. Yet, disclosures have been inadequate, and content policy is reactive, not proactive. In a recent interview, Mr. Zuckerberg admitted, ""Frankly, we didn't spend enough time investing in or thinking through some of the downside uses of the tool."" Today, we are asking for a more forward-looking, transparent and accountable approach. DAVID KLING: Thank you. And for Proposal 7, a proposal regarding median pay by gender, Ms. Lamb will again be speaking on behalf of Arjuna Capital. NATASHA L. LAMB: Again, my name is Natasha Lamb, and I move Proposal #7 on behalf of Arjuna Capital and Baldwin Brothers, Inc. asking for a report on gender pay equity. This is the third year this proposal has gone to a vote. Yet, reporting remains limited to qualitative assurances rather than a quantitative approach adopted by peers. In Arjuna Capital's recent gender pay disclosure scorecard, Facebook earned a failing grade across 9 metrics. The median income for women working full time in the United States is 80% of that earned by men, a gap that is not expected to close for 40 years. Of note, the gap for African-American and Latino women is wider at 60% and 55%, respectively. Gender and intersecting racial pay inequity represent a structural barrier to diverse leadership, posing a risk to company's performance and investor returns. Of particular note, the United Kingdom now mandates disclosure of median gender pay gap. In the U.S., investor engagement has thus far led to disclosures not on median pay but statistically adjusted equal pay for equal work numbers, assessing the pay of men and women performing similar jobs. Facebook says they pay men and women fairly on this basis. But unlike peers, they do so in the absence of quantitative backing. And while U.S. peers have taken a good first step towards disclosure, the equal pay for equal work number alone fails to address how discrimination affects differences in opportunity. That is, it does not reflective the bias in the jobs women hold. The median pay gap reflects a structural deficit when men hold the majority of higher paying jobs. Facebook published and reported the median pay gap for its United Kingdom operations that it's near 10%, but it has not published the global median pay gap requested by today's proposal. PayScale reports Facebook has a mean pay gap of 18%, over $20,000. Top proxy adviser, Institutional Shareholder Services, recommend support for this proposal noting, ""The equal pay for equal work statistic does not address the reported systemic bias that has resulted in the low number of women compared to men employed at the company, particularly the low number of women compared to men in technical and senior leadership roles, which tend to have higher pay. A vote for this resolution is warranted by reporting gender pay gap statistics similarly as is required to do in the U.K. Facebook could provide shareholders with a better gauge of how its diversity initiatives are improving opportunities for women."" Our company is best served by a proactive approach to address this structural bias, quantitative reporting and goals to close the median gender pay gap. Thank you. DAVID KLING: Thank you. Finally, for Proposal 8, a proposal regarding tax principles, [Gary Coleman] will be speaking on behalf of the AFL-CIO Reserve Fund. [Mr. Coleman]? UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Actually, it's [Richard Phillips] presenting, but I'm here to present on Item 8 on behalf of the AFL-CIO, a proposal to request that the board articulate a set of responsible global tax principles that ensure that the company pays taxes where value is actually created, ensure that these tax principles are aligned with Facebook's stated goals regarding sustainability and consider the economic and reputational impact of Facebook's global tax strategies. The company's stated principle of complying with existing tax law is noble, but a commitment to leave a compliance alone is clearly not enough to ensure that the company's tax principles are aligned with the desired sustainability and transparency goals, nor has it resulted in tax practices that do not cause reputational harm to the company. The company has already been caught up in multinational tax scandals in the U.K. and the U.S. and is investing significant time and resources into a legal battle with the IRS. In fact, Facebook has already acknowledged that it could owe somewhere between $3 billion and $5 billion in additional taxes. Scandal is not good for the company's bottom line. Trying to increase profit through tax-avoidance strategies provide an inaccurate picture of the company's financial performance and health and doesn't make up for the reputational damage and losses resulting from the scandals. Growth in new membership and engagement are currently expected to decline. The loss of young users in recent years and loss of U.S. users' trust in following the Cambridge Analytica scandal has been widely covered in the media. Another tax scandal could result in even greater losses of users and reputation, which reduce the attractiveness of the platform to advertisers, the company's almost sole source of revenue. The tax-avoidance strategies used by Facebook and other companies have attracted attention from governments and policymakers here and in Europe, who face rising public pressure to end such practices. As tax laws change and enforcement increases, the possibility of large fines and interest payments may also increase. A set of responsible tax principles will help, the board more easily adapts strategies as laws change, avoiding or limiting fines and interest payments and putting the company ahead of the curve by reducing uncertainty caused by changes in tax laws and enforcement. Corporate tax avoidance has resulted in the loss of tens of billions of dollars from U.S. revenue and across countries around the world, which has devastating impact in many communities. Facebook is about building and connecting communities. Shouldn't its tax practices contribute to that goal? We urge you to vote in favor of this. DAVID KLING: Thank you for your statements. The company will not be providing statements at this meeting as the company's position on each proposal has already been set forth in the proxy statement. We will now be collecting any remaining ballots. Please raise your ballots, and our volunteers will come around to collect them. It will just take a minute or 2 -- or a second or 2 to collect the ballots. Got one over there, I think. One more. One more. (Voting) DAVID KLING: Okay. All votes have been cast on the proposals to be considered at this meeting. And as of 11:28, the polls are now closed. I will now confer with the Inspector of Election and report on the preliminary results of the voting. So based on the preliminary report from the Inspector of Election, the vote required to approve Proposal 1 is a plurality of the voting power of our Class A and B common stock voting together as a single class. And again, based on the results tabulated on a preliminary fashion by the Inspector of Election, each of the 8 nominees has been elected to the Board of Directors. The vote required to approve Proposals 2 through 8 is the majority of the voting power of the Class A and Class B common stock voting together as a single class, in each case, properly cast for or against the proposal. Based on the preliminary results tabulated by the Inspector of Election, Proposal 2 has been approved by at least the requisite majority of the votes cast. And Proposals 3 through 8 have been rejected by at least the requisite majority of the votes cast. Final results of the voting will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on a Form 8-K within 4 business days. There are no other items of business on the agenda, so this concludes the formal part of our meeting. The annual meeting is now adjourned. Now before I ask Mark to come to the stage, I want to remind you that Mark's remarks and the Q&A that follows may contain forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. We caution you to consider the important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These risk factors are more fully detailed under the caption Risk Factors in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on April 26, 2018. In addition, any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions as of this date, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. Mark? MARK ELLIOT ZUCKERBERG, FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN & CEO, FACEBOOK, INC.: All right. Thanks for all coming out. How are you doing this morning? Thank you. So this is -- a lot has happened since the last year when we were here, and we faced a number of important issues I want to get through in just a minute. But before talking about that, despite the important issues that we faced, our continue -- our community and our business continued to grow really well. Now more than 2.2 billion people use Facebook every month around the world. More than 1.4 billion people use Facebook every day, and that doesn't even include the work that we're doing with WhatsApp and Instagram as well on top of that. In addition, the business continues to grow. In Q1, the business grew by about 49% in revenue to more than $12 billion in revenue. So that shows a lot of good continued momentum and that we're continuing to serve a lot of businesses around the world well. Now when I think about where we are now as a company, the big theme that we're focused on is making sure that we take a broader view of our responsibility to everyone we serve, the people in our community, the businesses we serve, the communities around us. And when I look back at the company's focus for the last decade or so, we've often focused on all the good that connecting people and technology can bring, and there's a lot, right? As these services have grown around the world, people have gotten powerful new tools to stay connected with people they care about, right? In terrible situations, like in Hurricane Harvey, people were able to come together and raise tens of millions of dollars to -- for the relief efforts and to help their fellow people in their community. And one of the things that we're most proud of is that there are more than 70 million small businesses around the world who use our tools to grow and to create jobs. And in polls that we've done, more than half of folks have told us that they're now hiring more people because of their use of Facebook's tools. So that's all good. But at the same time, I think it's also clear that over the last several years, we didn't do enough to be proactive in looking at how people could try to abuse these tools as well. And that goes for a lot of the things that we've all been reading about and thinking about, whether that's fake news or interference in elections or having app developers making sure they don't misuse people's information in ways that people don't want. So the main thing that we need to do right now is make sure that we take a broader view of what our responsibility is to our community, not just reacting when issues come up but being more proactive about going out and making sure that there's less of bad content in the system, making sure that it's harder for any kind of nation-states interfering in anyone else's election and making sure that all of the app developers who signed up to use our system are getting reviewed before they -- their apps go live and that we'll work proactively auditing more of the work to make sure that all the people in our system are doing good work. So that's what we're going to do, and we've dramatically increased the investment that we're making in security and use different kinds of investment, so much so that we expect that the dramatic increase in security investments is going to affect our profitability going forward. But we believe that, that is the right thing to do for our community and will serve both our community and our business better over the long term. So we feel good about that and feel like that is clearly the right thing to do. I want to walk through for a couple of minutes some of the specific things that we're doing to be more proactive. On the content side, we're -- whether we're talking about issues like fake news or hate speech or governments trying to interfere an election, the road map is to just be more proactive in reviewing the content. So instead of -- what we've done historically if people share what they want, and then people can -- if you see something bad in -- on the surface, you flag it and we look at it reactively. We're now investing a lot more in building AI tools to go out and be able to proactively find problematic content. And one of the areas that we're really proud of is that if you take terrorist content, for example, 99% of the ISIS and Al Qaeda-related content that we take down is flagged by our AI systems now before any person in our community gets to it and flags it for us. So we think that it's possible to have that kind of good result across a broader number of areas as well. We, by the end of this year, are going to have more than 20,000 people at the company working on security and content review. And we're rolling out other kinds of tools, like the terrorist-related tool that I just mentioned, to make sure that it's harder to spread fake news and for governments to interfere as well. And in rolling those out, we've already started to see better results in different elections, including the French presidential election, the German election, the Alabama special election in the last year, where we've been able to take down tens of thousands of fake accounts that could have been trying to do sketchy things. In addition to being more proactive about governing and managing the content, we're also very focused on being more transparent. So that way, we can, on a regular cadence, be reporting to the world on the types of bad content that we're finding, whether it's violent content or hate speech or fake accounts. We started rolling out these transparency reports, including one in the last month that just highlighted the dramatic increase of attempts that we're seeing to create fake accounts on the service. In the last quarter alone, we took down more than 500 million fake accounts that were created, mostly the vast majority of which within minutes of being created or during the process to create them. So it's a big effort that we need to do to push on that and make sure that the community stays safe and that we can keep people safe. And we think that working on transparency is going to be a good way to how people in the community judge our progress towards this and hold us accountable for what we're doing. We also think that transparency is going to be helpful for holding advertisers and other folks in our ecosystem accountable, too. So one of the things that we're doing, especially on the political side to make sure that people aren't trying to advertise in elections in ways that violate the law or our community standards, we're going to make it so that here, now, every person who's trying to advertise and run political ads or issue ads needs to be verified. Or if you're running a big page that has a lot of followers, you'll need to have your identity verified by sharing with us a government ID, so that we know you're not a fake account who is trying to spread bad content. So those kind of transparency efforts, verifying and making sure that the ads, content that people run, that now anyone can go look at all the ads that a page are running, those kind of steps are going to make it harder for bad actors in the system to interfere or spread bad content. And we think that that's going to have a very positive effect in making the service better for people who use it and having a broader and more positive impact on society overall. So I wanted to make sure I hit those points upfront because that's so important and it's so much of what we're focused on now, and I'm happy to take more questions on that when we go to Q&A in a minute. But before we do that, I also want to talk about some of the things that we're doing to keep building going forward. Because right now, I feel like our biggest responsibility is keeping people safe and interrupting some of these issues, but we also have a responsibility to keep building new ways for people to connect in new meaningful ways. I mean, that's what people ultimately rely on us for and why they come to our services and the unique value that we provide. So we need to make sure that we keep doing that, too. So we're doing that across all of the apps and things that we're building. In Facebook, for the app, the main focus is on helping people connect more with their friends and family and building communities. We've changed the way the News Feed works to highlight more friends and family content and prioritize interactions and conversations rather than just passively consuming viral videos and content that can take a lot of your time. We're focused on building communities and helping people find communities on Facebook that are going to be meaningful to them, whether that's a group for new parents or people who might share a disease that you have or some other interest you have, whether that's around volunteering or coming together in some way. A lot of the groups that people join on Facebook are -- a lot of people tell us they're some of the most meaningful parts of their experience there. On Instagram, a lot of the focus is on just helping people capture any moment that they want. Stories on Instagram are growing incredibly quickly. It's been extremely successful. I think that there's a huge opportunity to continue growing that new format for just sharing video and photos throughout your day. And in general, that's going really well. WhatsApp around the world is just -- it continues to grow extremely quickly between WhatsApp and Messenger, our 2 messaging services. People now send almost 100 billion messages every day. So that is dramatically bigger than the global volume of SMS. People love these services. People love the security and the encryption on WhatsApp. People really like the features and the ability to share in rich ways on Messenger. And we're going to keep building those out as well. And while we focus on messaging, a big part of the trend that we're seeing is that people don't just like texting each other, they really like video chat, right? That's, I think, a really important trend for the future and across WhatsApp and Messenger and now Instagram, where we're rolling that out, too. It's going to be billions of minutes every day. People are going to be able to not just call someone, hear their voice, but be able to see the person that they're talking to. And I don't know about you guys and how you've used this, but I know when I'm traveling, it just makes a huge difference to me to be able to see my kids when I call home at night, and that just makes a big difference to me. And we hear similar feedback from a lot of people around the world who use this. So I want to make sure we have enough time to get to Q&A, so I'm going to wrap up. But it is a really important time for our community and our business and for the company. We face a number of important issues. We're going to make sure that we take a broader view of our responsibility, a more proactive approach to managing and making sure that the content and app developers who are interacting in the community are abiding by our standards. And at the same time, we also feel a responsibility to keep building the next generation of new experiences that are going to help us all connect in meaningful new ways. And that's going to be the plan for the next period of time. And I thank you all for being our shareholders and supporting us and being along for this journey to do something that I think is really important in the world. So thank you. Questions and Answers DAVID KLING: Thanks, Mark. I'd now like to invite Sheryl Sandberg, our COO; Dave Wehner, our CFO; and Elliot Schrage, our VP of Communications and Policy, to join Mark and answer some questions. We'll now open the floor for questions from the audience. We anticipate taking questions until approximately 12:15. So we can answer as many questions as possible. We request that you ask only one question and limit your question to no more than 1 minute. If you have a question, please line up behind one of the microphones, 2 sets of microphones here. If you can't get to a mic, please raise your hand, and someone will bring one to you. As stated in the rules of conduct, please, stockholder should not address the meeting until they're recognized. All right. Let's take the first question from Reverend Jackson. JESSE L. JACKSON, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, THE RAINBOW PUSH COALITION, INC.: Good morning. Let me express my thanks to you, Mark, and to Sheryl. Today, we respect your integrity and your intent, question of judgment [is -- connect to] inclusion. We've globalized technology, but not globalize human rights, workers' rights, women and children rights, [environmental security] must globalize. Unless we do, we'll find ourselves in a big hole. The leadership more diverse on boards of election -- on boards a few years ago, going from 3 to 20 in the last 5 years. I want to thank you for putting tension on the most able businessmen on the board, brings about a lot of experience that will be a value to the company. But beyond the board, the C suites, the top 15 employees are white, and that does not represent a random. It represents some lack of intention now to be inclusive. We now know that at stake here is elections. And while there's a big focus on the national election out of Washington, many of us lose or win based on 5,000 votes, not 5 million votes. The question becomes, are we secured in the next -- in the 2018 election and congressional elections and then state elections? We know that the Russians sought to undermine the system last time around, and that had some impact. Has that impact been eliminated this time around? And it seems that everybody seem to accept the present. We all must care about this. We really brought dialogue today. There's a sense of urgency now about the integrity of our election, the integrity of our election that we globalize human rights as we have globalized technology. Thank you very much. MARK ELLIOT ZUCKERBERG: Thank you. We appreciate your commitment as a shareholder and always coming to our meetings. The -- I'm going to talk about the election issue, and then I think we have an announcement today that we want to make on diversity, which Sheryl will speak to. On -- the election integrity issue is one of the most important issues that we face and that we need to make sure that we deliver on. There's no doubt that in 2016, we were slow as a company in identifying the kind of misinformation operations that Russia tried to run. We were looking for more traditional types of cyber attacks, like traditional kinds of hacking and phishing of people's accounts. And we found a lot of those, and we notified people. But we weren't tracking this new threat. And since then, it has been a big wake-up call, and we've invested a huge amount in building AI tools and stepping up the new content review and making a lot of the systems more transparent around the ads that people run. And the thing that gives me a lot of confidence going into 2018 is that there have been a number of important elections since the 2016 election where we've seen adversaries try to do similar attacks, and we've been much more successful at being able to thwart them. So I mentioned in my opening comments the French presidential election, the German national election, the Alabama Special Election in the last year, and those were all elections where we saw people trying to spread bad content and where our AI systems were able to identify and proactively take down tens of thousands of fake accounts before they can do anything that would be a problem. At the same time, we're taking more proactive steps as well around partnering with election commissions and countries. So a lot of the issues that we noticed in Germany were flagged by the German government and the election commission there. So that's an important part of the playbook going forward. And increasing transparency. So now around advertising, overall, if you're an advertiser and you're running ads to different people and different audiences, anyone can now -- will be able to go to -- when we roll out this tool, the advertiser's page, whether it's a business or a political actor, can be able to see every single message that, that advertiser is sending out to different audiences. So that will make it much harder for anyone to be disingenuous and say different things to different people. That will hold people more accountable. And on top of that, we're also going to verify the identities of anyone running political or issue ads, starting in the U.S. and a couple of countries but then spreading more broadly beyond that, to make sure that it's much more difficult to have any repeat of the kind of issues that we had seen in the past. So this is an incredibly important issue. 2018 is a very big election year, not just in the U.S. for the midterms but around the world. There are big elections in Mexico, in Brazil, in India coming up in the next year, Indonesia. A number of big elections around Europe. The EU elections in 2019 coming up. So we are on this, and this is a really big focus of ours to make sure that now that we're aware of this security threat, we're going to make it significantly harder for anyone to do that in the future. And the last thing that I do want to say is that these kind of security issues, you never fully solve them, right? So security is an arms race, and we're going to keep investing in order to make sure that we stay ahead of these adversaries. But some of the adversaries that we face are very well funded and very motivated. And it's going to be a constant battle that we're going to need to keep on pushing on, and we're never going to be able to just rest on our laurels or say that we've done enough, and what we're going to do is just need to keep on pushing on. But this is definitely a huge focus for us. And given some of the recent results, we feel more confident about the path going forward. JESSE L. JACKSON: Are there consequences when people break the law or try to break? Are there consequences when people break the law or get caught trying to break the law? MARK ELLIOT ZUCKERBERG: Well, those consequences would be more of the governments to enforce, but we certainly don't want to let them advertise on our platform. ELLIOT SCHRAGE, VP OF GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS, MARKETING & PUBLIC POLICY, FACEBOOK, INC.: But of course, we work very closely with law enforcement when we find problems, or they come to us. We collaborate with them, not just in the United States but around the world. Sheryl, do you want to talk a little bit... SHERYL KARA SANDBERG, COO & DIRECTOR, FACEBOOK, INC.: Yes. And I would just share, we agree with you, Reverend. [I thought I'd lost you]. We agree with you that we need more diversity. It's something we're very committed to. In the last year, we appointed a Chief Diversity Officer, who's here. Maxine's here somewhere. Yes, there she is. And we also have an announcement to make today. We announced today in partnership with the SEIU leaders who are here and then also with your encouragement, that we're officially adopting the diverse slate approach for board members going forward, which means we -- yes. Thank you. We followed this approach for our last 4 members. We're also doing this increasingly around the company. So this is really codifying and making a public commitment to something we were already doing. But we wanted to make that commitment publicly both to maintain it going forward, but also because we think that's a good thing for people in our industry and other companies to do. So thank you for your support of that, and thank you to all of our partners who are here who worked with us on that. DAVID KLING: Great. Thank you. Let's move to the other aisle and take first questions from this side. PATRICK DOHERTY: Yes. Mr. Chairman, fellow shareholders, my name is Patrick Doherty, and I'm here today on behalf of New York State Comptroller - Thomas DiNapoli as sole trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, holder of over 6.6 million Facebook shares valued at over $1 billion. It's one of our largest holdings. As previously noted, our fund was a cosponsor of Proposal #6, calling on the company to review and report on the efficacy of its content management policies. Comptroller DiNapoli recently pointed out that, ""Hundreds of millions of social media users are at risk of being exposed to fake news, hate speech and sexual harassment if the company cannot enforce its own user agreements. Unless safeguards are put in place, the company is at risk of financial losses, lawsuits and serious reputational damage. Facebook needs to confront that its customers and its investors want protection against abusers of the platform. The company can receive -- can reassure millions of users by clearly explaining how it will enforce its own terms of service to prevent sexual harassment, fake news, hate speech and other prohibited behavior on the platform."" Thank you. ELLIOT SCHRAGE: So why don't I respond to that? Mark alluded to that in his remarks where he talked in 2 dimensions, first, about the broader sense of responsibility that we have towards protecting the community that we serve. And the way that we do that is really through the mechanism that he described, and that was introduced in the resolution, which is this concept of transparency about telling people what's happening on our platform and telling people what we're doing about it across all of these dimensions. And we've taken a lot of steps over the course of the last year, and particularly even the last few months, in being much more explicit so that people can see what we're doing and frankly hold us accountable. The 2 biggest steps that we've really taken have to do with our community standards in terms of -- up until, I think, April of this year, we published a more general sense of our community standards. It's really our principles by which we define what a safe environment is on Facebook. But what we did more recently was we went into much greater detail of specifying the particular kinds of behaviors, whether it's with respect to incitement or hate speech, whether it's with respect to other forms of content that we evaluate and determine are not permitted on our platform. And we didn't stop there. What we did -- so that was in April. But just earlier this month, just a couple of weeks ago, we released a transparency report. Now we've done that before where we talk about all of the work that we're doing to take down content, for example, as a result of government requests or law enforcement-related. But for the first time ever, we introduced this idea of being transparent about precisely what you're asking, how many pieces of content or how much content is prevalent on our service with respect to hate speech, nudity, violence or other objectionable content that violates our standards. And we introduced for the first time methodologies so that people can understand how we examine this problem and how we assess our performance. Now to be sure this is the first time the methodologies are evolving and adapting, and we'll be changing those. But we thought it was essential so that our shareholders, our users and all of the members of the Facebook community can understand the steps that we're taking and how we're doing it. DAVID KLING: Great. Thanks, Elliot. Let's come back to this side. NELL GREENBERG: My name is Nell Greenberg. I'm a member of Avaaz, and I'm here representing millions of people around the world who are concerned by this information. And this is specifically a question about false accounts. I really hear you guys trying. I hear that you're genuine about it. But in your own quarterly report, it shows that false accounts rose from 3% last year to 4% this year. In 2012, there was a court case that came out last year that said that your own engineers say that it was a no-brainer to detect and delete those accounts and that the board directs them not to because of revenue. I know that your revenue model would incentivize you not to remove all accounts or bots or duplicate accounts. I know that you -- because governments don't understand your platform, because citizens don't, you can put forward halfway measures that halfway deal with this problem. I am asking you, will you direct your engineers to delete as many of those false accounts as possible to get that number from 4%, where it's at now, to as close to zero, as you can? And I'm not just talking about the new accounts that you delete every second. I'm talking about the old existing accounts. Just 6 Russian accounts were able to influence billions of people. So I'm directly asking you, what are you directing your engineers to do now about all the false accounts still on your site? Thank you so much, and I really do appreciate the steps that you've taken so far. MARK ELLIOT ZUCKERBERG: Yes. Just to be clear, we want to delete all of the fake accounts that we see. So I don't know what the quote was that you just pulled out around saying that we somehow find fake accounts and don't want to delete them. But there's no way that, that's right. And I want to make sure that, that's clear to people here, and it's going to be clear -- and it's clear to the people inside our company as well. People don't like fake accounts. It doesn't help our product. It doesn't help our business. Getting rid of them is good. We need to do that, and the reason why there is some percent of fake accounts, it's because it is actually quite hard to be perfect at this. As we released in the transparency report, we were able to take down and stop more than 0.5 billion fake accounts from being created. The ones that get through, we also have efforts to try to find them once they're in the system. But this is hard stuff. And we have a large team that's focused on doing this, that's working on very sophisticated AI techniques to be able to identify what the fake actors are in the system. And when we find them, we take them down. But I don't want there to be any question about the motives or the way that we think about this because I think we absolutely agree this is a big issue. It's a product issue, and it doesn't serve our community when those are there, and we're going to take a lot of measures as we continue to do to make sure that we get rid of them. DAVID KLING: Great. Over here. UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Good morning. My name is [Andre Kranell], and I'm a senior at Berkeley High School. My question for you, Facebook's impending 750,000-square-foot deal of all Park Tower will make you one of San Francisco's largest tech tenants. How will you help build housing for your workers since the inventory is low already? ELLIOT SCHRAGE: Let me take that. But that's -- it's a great question. We talk about bringing people together as a corporate mission and building communities. It's also something that we take incredibly seriously as a company in the real world in terms of the physical communities. We've been really focused in addressing issues of housing, economic opportunity, and frankly, also transportation. That began as we built out our corporate headquarters here in Menlo Park. And it's exactly for that reason that we're expanding, partly because the space here has been tight, but partly also because we view the challenges of expanding our headquarters, not as a challenge for Menlo Park, but it's a real challenge for the Bay Area. And we've really spearheaded -- I'm actually very proud of the efforts we've made to address housing issues. We've spearheaded an initiative that began in Menlo Park with our partners right across the way at East Palo Alto to put together a housing fund focused on affordable housing. That started out at $18.5 million -- with an $18.5 million commitment from us. That's now with a partnership of LISC. It is now up to $75 million. We've just added in the last couple of months a partnership with the San Francisco Foundation. We've got an additional $1 million from them. Our goal is to address 3 sets of issues. One, to bring in additional partners on affordable housing from the private sector because we think the private sector has a huge responsibility. If we are employing people, we also have to create an environment where they can live and commute easily. So that's absolutely one. Transportation is another issue, where we've been working both in the community here. Anybody who lives in Menlo Park knows that traffic is a challenge. We've been working very closely with the city here. It's an issue that we've work with, frankly, in San Francisco as well with respect to our shuttle buses and making sure that the shuttle buses cooperate with the SFMTA. And also an economic opportunity. Because even as we bring the people in for high tech and more sophisticated jobs, we also want to have people across the income spectrum be able to benefit from the economic opportunities that are created by us and other tech companies. I think you'll see that with our new facilities in San Francisco, we will become even more active in the communities there. Some of the investments and the funds that we have created for the local area around here are going to expand, not just for housing, but for community service across the board. DAVID KLING: Thanks. On this side. UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: Mark, I'm -- my name is [Eric Sprague]. I'm a shareholder from the Sacramento area. Last earnings call, you said that messaging is more transactional than feed. And there was a Bloomberg article this week saying that WhatsApp payments could transition soon from a pilot program such that it's fully live. So I'd like to know your thoughts on the landscape there with competitors like Google Pay. But also more broadly, you've said the goal isn't necessarily payments but helping businesses be more efficient using messaging. The Philippines example is nice. I'd like to know about more examples, if you can't go too in depth today, if there's some sources you could cite that I could read about. Thanks. MARK ELLIOT ZUCKERBERG: Sure. So overall, we think that news feed is good for sharing information broadly. But in general, if you, as a business, are sharing something in news feed or you're putting an ad there, then a lot of people are going to see your content. Whereas, messaging is more one on one, right, by its nature. So if news feed is good for generating awareness about what your business is doing, then we think that messaging could be an ideal surface for closing the loop and actually completing transactions or doing customer support after a transaction or buying more things after you've already bought something and continuing a relationship that you have with the business. Payments, they're going to be one part of that. So we don't view payments as the business itself, but payments are one tool for people and businesses to be able to do what we think they want to do in these threads, which is interact around and do transactions. We're certainly working on rolling that out more broadly. We've gotten good feedback so far on the pilot program in India around WhatsApp and are optimistic about that. And then -- and for specific cases around businesses having success in Messenger, we should follow up and make sure you get to see this video that we produced for F8 in which -- where we have a number of our partners talking through F8 at our developer conference, with a bunch of the business that you are building these experiences in Messenger walk through the success that they have had. And we can certainly send you the resources on that. DAVID KLING: Great. Up here. UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Good morning. My name is [Dween Silliman] from SumOfUs. We're a corporate accountability non-profit with millions of members worldwide. And my first question is about whether the voting percentages for the board position confirmation, will those be available? DAVID KLING: Yes. Yes. Those will be published on our SEC site within 4 business days. So we publish a full report of all the voting. UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Great. And the main question I had is, will the board commission at study to evaluate the impact on shareholder value in breaking up Facebook's business lines and this in light of the recent inquiry opened up by the FTC? DAVID KLING: Great. Thank you. I think we do not anticipate issuing a report like that right now, but we thank you for your question. Over on this side. JUSTIN DANHOF: Good morning. My name is Justin Danhof, General Counsel with the National Center for Public Policy Research. Mr. Zuckerberg, you mentioned you have 20,000 or so employees working on content. You stated before Congress that you don't know the politics of those individuals and that politics plays no role in hiring decisions here at Facebook. However, you also said that you are well aware that Silicon Valley is primarily populated by liberals. You then suggested that you are aware of employee political bias and try to make sure it does not affect their work. How do you know their political bias if you don't know their politics? You also said that politics play no role in what content these individuals decide to remove. I just don't see how all those things can be true at the same time. In 2016, former employees told Gizmodo how the company was diminishing conservative voices on your platform. Before Congress, it was conservatives such as Ted Cruz who continued to complain about Facebook silencing their voices. And now a group of more than a dozen prominent conservative organizations have formed a coalition to combat what they see is Facebook censorship of their voices. Silicon Valley leads often preen about commitments to diversity inclusion, but I don't think many of you know what that means. Diversity isn't what someone looks like. It's the sum of what they think, feel and believe. Perhaps, you should consider actually talking with your employees and potential hires about their politics. Because when it comes to Silicon Valley, the region seems to suffer from a lack of viewpoint diversity. Hiring a few conservatives may help balance out the office and avoid potential groupthink problems. Will you commit to increasing viewpoint diversity amongst the ranks of Facebook? And what tangible steps can you take to commit to doing that? MARK ELLIOT ZUCKERBERG: Sure. So it's really important to me and to the company that Facebook and our systems are platforms for all different ideas. And I know that there are a number of concerns about that kind of bias. Silicon Valley, I mean, generally, is a very left-leaning place, right? So without knowing or asking specific people at Facebook for their views, I think that, that's a reasonable assumption, is that a lot of the people who work -- and based on our Silicon Valley headquarters are going to be -- are going to skew that way. But the people who are doing content review are all around the world. So I don't know that, that same leaning would exist. But regardless, we have very strict guidelines on how these policies need to be enforced. And if people aren't doing what the guidelines say, then they're not going to be able to continue doing that job. So we're very serious about that at the level of content review. Across the company, I do think that having different voices is incredibly important. And we have a number of people from all different political and ideological views on the board, on the management team and all of the different roles. And I do think that, that is an important aspect of making sure that we represent all the people in our community well. So we care about this. We're committed to being a platform for all ideas. I understand the concern that people have. Although I personally view, from the work that we've done so far and what I've seen in the results, that I don't think the concerns are necessarily founded, although I understand why -- if people might have them. And we're certainly committed to being a platform for all ideas. DAVID KLING: Great. Thanks. Over here. UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: I'd like to start off by thanking you guys. I think you guys have done a phenomenal job the last few months weathering the adversities. So keep up the good work. The CEO of Snapchat recently made a comment about how he wished Facebook would copy their data protection practices. As a shareholder and user of Facebook, I know you've stressed in recent months the changes you and your team are making to protect data and the privacy of the user. But I wanted to ask if you've explored other companies' policies and practices such as Snapchat's to use as a model going forward? MARK ELLIOT ZUCKERBERG: So yes, this is a major thing that we think about. And I can give you 2 examples just from within our own product, right? We can talk about WhatsApp on the one hand and then Facebook on the other, which have very different approaches to basically using data to deliver a service. There's a core tension, I think, that people face, which is, on the one hand, I think most people don't want a lot of their data to be out there. They don't want to give -- they want to give as little of their data to services as possible. And that's why a service like WhatsApp is built to be encrypted, so we don't see the message and content that's there. And that's a lot of the value that, I think, people perceive. At the same time, if people are going to see content and they're going to see ads, they want the ads to be good, right? So we recently went through this process of rolling out our flows and settings for GDPR compliance, first, in Europe, and we're going to do it around the world. And one of the settings that we ask people proactively to make a decision on is, do you want your ads, for how we do ad targeting, to be informed by the other apps and websites that you use? People have to proactively make a decision. Yes or no. Do they want that data used? And the majority, I think we can even say vast majority of people say, yes, they want that data used. Because if they're going to see ads, you want to see good ads, right? So I think that this is one of the core questions that society faces and individuals face across the different services that we use, are how do we want our data to be used and where? In some cases, we may want it to be encrypted so that companies can see it, like with WhatsApp. And in other cases like what we're seeing with ranking for content in news feed and ads, what we're seeing is people generally want us to be able to use the full set of available data in order to give them the best experience possible. This is not a simple issue that's only going to have one answer, which is why I think that they're going to keep on being questions about this and as we define new products. This is going to be a core thing that we need to think about going forward, but we think about it very deeply as this is a -- just a core part of the value that we're trying to provide. DAVID KLING: Thanks, Mark. MICHAEL G. VERDONE: Michael Verdone. I am past President of San Mateo County Association of Realtors, and I'm a Director for the National Association of REALTORS on Public Policy. I almost sat down when I heard the young gentleman talk about housing, which is primarily my question. And yet, when I hear $1 million here, $1 million there, it doesn't really address the issue. I was thinking $1 million doesn't buy a single-family home here on the Peninsula. I'd like to know, especially in light of -- you reported that you're going to be increasing your staff here by almost $30,000 -- excuse me, 30,000 employees, which is pretty much the population of all of Menlo Park. I'd like to know, what are you going to do to be a lot more proactive in maybe building your own workforce housing so it takes off the pressure from housing prices, rentals, transportation? And I certainly applaud what you're doing with respect to the Dumbarton project that may be -- existing in transportation. But you need to do something locally for workforce housing, building your own housing perhaps to handle these employees. Thank you. MARK ELLIOT ZUCKERBERG: Yes. And just to be clear, we're -- we bought a bunch of land for our offices, and we're dedicating a bunch of that land to housing. And we got a special allotment to be able to build housing on that instead. That way, there can be more housing in the community, and Elliot can take... ELLIOT SCHRAGE: Again, I can go on and on and on. It may be -- look, our position is that Silicon Valley has been this extraordinary engine of economic opportunity. And if we can't solve the housing and transportation issues, Silicon Valley won't be Silicon Valley. These companies, like ours, will expand elsewhere. So we feel a real sense of urgency around that. And you're right that some of the numbers are small, but that's just our piece contributing. Frankly, those numbers are primarily for affordable housing. We're working very closely with other developers. And we have the construction in Menlo Park. We are dedicating resources for mixed-use housing on our campus. Part of the reason that we've moved facilities to San Francisco is to have a broader catchment area for housing. But as you suggested with Dumbarton, we see real opportunities for helping address some of the housing issues by absolutely transforming the transportation nightmare that exists today. So if we can really get the Dumbarton corridor to be a more effective mechanism for transportation, 50% of the people who come to Facebook's headquarters already in Menlo Park do not drive. They come either by shuttle bus. They come by other -- by Caltrans or other forms of transportation. If we can get a better public transportation, more different kinds of services, including, for example, ferry services, we feel that there are real opportunities to reduce the extraordinary pressure people feel. And the good news -- and then the good news is that people are coming together around this. I think there are -- Google is very focused on this. Genentech is another company we work extremely closely with. The industry is coming together. Governments are cooperating in ways they have not before. So again, if you want to talk bigger dollars, since some of the ballot measures that are up for California, even as regional measure 3, there are governments that are now focused on providing the resources necessary. We are late, and frankly, we have been slow. We are actually a relatively newcomer as a young company at only 15, but I think it is fair to say that we have really made an investment, and we consider this an existential issue if we're going to remain a company in Silicon Valley for the long term. UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: [Charles Aiken Hansen] from Atlanta, Georgia. And I'm a Ph. D. student in Instructional Technology there at Georgia State University. So regarding transparency, what qualitative -- sorry, what quantitative and mixed message research methodologies are you all currently engaging in, in response to the voted-down proposals which are pitched by or on behalf of the different stockholders? Adjectives and descriptive phrases like big jump, dramatic change are pleasant-sounding but ultimately meaningless on a grand or pragmatic scale. Although, I understand there are confidentiality and disclosure agreements, what can be said to reassure that we, stockholders, are being heard and having our salient concerns addressed again in response to the voted-down proposals? So I know you mentioned certain methodologies were being disclosed. So I would like to know either where are those and then what further disclosure will be made to let us know that we are being heard. ELLIOT SCHRAGE: Sure. With respect to the transparency -- with respect to the content issue, I think my point is we're doing what's already -- it's not that we're committing to doing it. We have already begun to do it. And we've done it in 3 ways. We've reported on the principles that guide our content decisions. We've given the details of the protocols of how we evaluate content decisions. And so what people -- people can know exactly what we take down and what we permit. And I have to confess that a lot of people are critical. They say, ""You're going too far and taking down too much stuff here, or you're not going far enough in these places."" But the step that we just went to in May was to actually give the numbers of the prevalence of these kinds of issues on our platform. All I was suggesting is it's the beginning. And even if we would have adopted the report, you have to start somewhere. So even if we had adopted the resolution, we would simply have begun a process of disclosing. What we're saying is we've already begun that process. The number is -- it's facebook.com/transparency (sic) [transparency.facebook.com], I believe, is the website. If you want to sit and -- if you want to chat afterwards, I can give you a long list of it. I should say, and again, these are my worlds, so I spent a lot of time on this. It's not limited to the transparency report. We've committed to transparency in disclosing all of these things. UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: May I reclarify? So what I mean by transparency is, for instance, the CDC currently doesn't study gun violence. So what I'm saying is, for instance, and I don't know what can be said because I don't (inaudible) recording. So for instance, when they were discussing the gender pay and discrepancy, to my knowledge from reading the proxy statement, they were talking about just proper reporting and more disclosure and better analysis and like I said research. So -- but that got voted down. So that's what I'm trying to say as far as transparency and research into the issues that we are bringing to light what is happening. Because as of right now, it's just like, ""Okay. Those are voted down."" DAVID KLING: Yes. Let me just jump in real quick on that. Sometimes, some of these proposals are voted down, but that doesn't mean that we don't think that there are important issues that are discussed. Or in many cases, that doesn't mean that we don't agree with some of the things that are said on those proposals. Oftentimes, it's just that we don't necessarily agree or the Board doesn't agree that, that's the best way to actually implement some of those things. So for example, content governance report. Having the board issue a one broad report that covers every single content governance issue on Facebook, that's not necessarily the way that we think it's best to approach that. We've taken a whole bunch of different steps. Elliot has gone through some of them. He can go on all day. It's literally true. So we are doing things... ELLIOT SCHRAGE: He means that in the nicest possible way. DAVID KLING: I do want to move on, though. We're actually -- we're out of time. I was going to say one last question. Let's do 2 last questions, perhaps. UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible) critical issue. DAVID KLING: We're actually -- we're trying to keep moving. So everyone will stay after... UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I've been asking with Facebook for 3 years now with these issues, and you don't speak to me. DAVID KLING: I'll speak to you afterwards. I will let... UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Get her a microphone. DAVID KLING: Yes. I'll let... UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So I mean, we talked about you're implementing it, you're doing it, but you're not actually talking to your investors about these issues and asking, ""Well, what are you looking for?"" Like, these aren't prescriptive proposals. These are fairly broad. Engage with us on these issues. And we're on the same team. We're looking for win-win here. So that's all I would say. DAVID KLING: And we agree with that. We do -- we actually -- and we do a number of the things that you've requested. We actually already do some of those things. So I want to keep moving so that we can actually get some of the people who've been waiting in line for 0.5 hours here. I'm going to move over to this side because the gentleman in front of you just gave up his spot. But... UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: I'm [Ryan]. I'm a senior in high school, proud owner of 2 whole shares. And I'm just -- I think it's amazing that Facebook's platform is used for so many different purposes and in so many different contexts. But I noticed the company, for some reason, hasn't made a lot of headway in the professional networking area. And I was wondering if you guys consider LinkedIn to be a competitor. And if so, in what ways are you chipping away at their market share? MARK ELLIOT ZUCKERBERG: So I would say -- I don't think -- I don't consider LinkedIn to be one of our more direct competitors, but we are trying to help people find jobs through Facebook. And I don't have the exact stats off the top of my head, but we started this effort in the last year. So basically, it makes us that -- all of the businesses have pages, right? And I mentioned before there are more than 70 million small businesses around the world that use the platform and have pages, can list the jobs that they want to hire for, and people can go search for those. And I think what we're seeing is something like -- it was a very large number. I don't want to get this wrong. Do you... ELLIOT SCHRAGE: I think it was hundreds of thousands. MARK ELLIOT ZUCKERBERG: Yes. That was what I remember, too. So hundreds of thousands, I think, in the U.S., right, of people who are basically finding jobs through these job listings. So that is -- we consider this to be an early product. It might not be exactly the same types of jobs that people network for on LinkedIn, but we think that this is a really important way that we can help small businesses, and businesses continue to grow, that we can help connect people with real opportunities and contribute to the economy and to the communities that we live in more broadly. So we're very focused on that, but more just as a way to provide value for the community than as some kind of competitive strategy that we have. SHERYL KARA SANDBERG: And I'll add one thing because it's one of the things I think we're most proud of, which is that all of these tens of millions of small businesses around the world, we've been surveying them both externally and internally for a long time. And about half of them will say that they are actually hiring people because of the growth they're getting from using our platform. So when you add that up, we put out report after report, but there are millions of jobs being created by these small businesses, and they're not tech jobs. This is your local bakery, your local florist, your local plumber, who is able to hire and grow and both find those people on Facebook to the product Mark was speaking, but more broadly, find the demand because they have customers who are going on Facebook. And so we believe very deeply in the responsibility we have to communities. You've heard about some of that in housing. Probably, the area we probably contribute the most is in creating small businesses and in helping businesses hire people all over the world. And that's the majority of jobs. The majority of jobs around the world is not large companies. It's small. So it's an area we are very focused and I think seeing real impact. DAVID KLING: Great. All right. Last question. I know there's a couple of people who are in line who didn't get a chance to ask a question. If you still want to ask a question, please find one of our volunteers. Write down your question, and we'll work to get an answer, or email it to investor@fb.com, and we'll work to get back to you. UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Thank you very much for the -- let me start off by saying thank you. Thank you for the environment. Thank you for the opportunity to ask my question. For context, my wife was the first director of marketing at Facebook back into 2005. I spent the last 10 years teaching doctors how to use Facebook as a tool and how to teach their communities how Facebook can be healthy for you. My question is, it feels by watching what's been going on for the past year, let's just say, that most of the marketing, most of the messaging has been very defensive. And my question is, why not be more proactive to teach businesses how to create meaningful content and really teach consumers, users of the platform, how they really are in much more control of what they see in the news feed by choosing who they accept as friends, by being able to curate it, so that much more responsibility gets back to them as opposed to what feels as both a shareholder and a consumer that the media just keeps punching Facebook as if it's all Facebook's fault, which I don't think it is. So my question is, why not more messaging to let people know that they have much more control of what they actually see in their news feed? MARK ELLIOT ZUCKERBERG: I think we need to do that, and that's certainly part of it, but we're a company that, I think, just takes a lot of responsibility when we see issues. And right now, there is a lot of criticism about the company. And I don't agree with all of it, but I think some of it is really fair in pointing out a lot of issues where we should have been doing a better job and where we're now committed to doing a better job. And as building -- it's kind of the culture that we want to build here. I want us to be a company that, first, takes ownership of issues and deals with our stuff before going out and asking other people to take responsibility for their part. But I do think you're right that this is shared. And I think that as we move towards the end of the year and into next year, we'll have really made a lot of progress on solving and really just moving forward on a lot of the issues that have been flagged. And that's our commitment and what we're going to focus on doing. SHERYL KARA SANDBERG: And we also have done, to your suggestion, many things that tell people the controls they have. So for example, we published into the top of News Feed, here are all the apps you're connected to and an easy way to delete them. Taking the GDPR controls, and we'll be rolling those out across the world, those do exactly what you're saying, which they give consumers the ability. When you look at our ad tools, you can go to any ad you see and you can see why am I seeing this ad and I don't want advertising from those advertisers. So you are right that while we're very focused on taking responsibility, we also are as part of that building tools that show consumers -- a lot of these are controls they've actually had for a long time, but we need to make them easier to use, easier to understand. You've seen a lot of that from us, and you're going to continue seeing it. So... MARK ELLIOT ZUCKERBERG: And more. SHERYL KARA SANDBERG: And more. Good suggestion, and we are working on that as well.

Meta_1Month,Facebook threatens to upend online dating market,1 May 2018,Financial Times (FT.Com),612 words,0.9914,0.102,0.028,0.87,"English Copyright 2018 The Financial Times Ltd.  Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. Facebook is moving into the online dating market, throwing the weight of the world’s largest social network behind a new feature that investors worry could usurp existing dating apps. The announcement from Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, sent stocks in the dating app industry tumbling. Match Group, the owner of Tinder and OkCupid as well as Match.com, and IAC, its parent company, lost hundreds of millions of dollars of market capitalisation. Mr Zuckerberg said one in three marriages in the US now start online and recounted tales of being approached in the street by happy couples who met on Facebook. Speaking on stage at Facebook’s annual developer conference in San Jose, he said introducing dating on the social network was part of his quest to shift people’s use away from mindless browsing to “meaningful connection”. Mr Zuckerberg said romantic relationships were “perhaps the most meaningful connection of all”, adding: “This is for real long-term relationships, not just hookups.” The growth of online dating is forecast to accelerate. E-Marketer, the research firm, predicts US dating app users will increase from 25.7m in 2018 to 36.1m in 2022. Creating a dating feature could also help Facebook increase the time spent on the app, particularly by younger users. There are 200m Facebook users who have their status marked as single. They will be able to use the feature in a separate part of the app, which does not show them their existing friends. Their dating profile will only show their first name and a limited selection of features. Mr Zuckerberg stressed that “privacy and safety” had been considered from the beginning. For example, users will only be able to send text, not photos, within the message section, presumably to prevent people from sharing naked pictures. “We’re surprised at the timing given the amount of personal and sensitive data that comes with this territory,” said Mandy Ginsberg, chief executive of Match. “We’re flattered that Facebook is coming into our space, and sees the global opportunity that we do.” Joey Levin, chief executive of IAC, made a joke at Facebook’s expense, referring to recent controversy over US election meddling. “Come on in. The water’s warm. Their product could be great for US/Russia relationships.” The new Facebook feature aims to get people to meet in real life by asking them to choose events and groups based around interests and then selecting potential partners who are attending those events or are interested in the same things. Only then can they begin to message. Chris Cox, Facebook’s chief product officer, said this mirrored the way people date in real life, at events and institutions. Until now, Facebook has been a friend, not a rival, of many dating apps. Tinder and private start-ups including Bumble, Hinge and The League rely on Facebook data to match users with suitable friends of friends, and to pull in Facebook pictures for use on a person’s dating profile. Shares in Match fell 22.1 per cent to $36.71, while IAC was down 17.8 per cent to $133.33. IAC owns 80 per cent of Match. Match Group has 7m users of its dating products, 3m of them on Tinder. It generated $379m in revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. Some of its services charge subscriptions, while Tinder charges for extra features such as being able to rewind to see a choice you previously rejected and being able to chat to people in locations far from your own. Operating income was $128m."
Meta_1Month,Russia’s election meddling ads published for first time,10 May 2018,Financial Times (FT.Com),758 words,0.9802,0.098,0.055,0.846,"English Copyright 2018 The Financial Times Ltd.  Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. Thousands of Facebook advertisements that Russian groups bought to sow division in US politics have been revealed for the first time, published by Democrats on the House intelligence committee. The more than three thousand ads provide the most extensive look yet at how a Russian disinformation campaign used the social network’s targeted advertising to reach groups on both sides of divisive issues such as gun control and gay rights. Published from 2015 to 2017, the ads show the Russian Internet Research Agency jumping on news events, including the Charleston shooting by Dylann Roof, police shootings, and calls for the removal of Confederate flags — and even a local mayor coming out as gay — to catch the attention of Facebook users. Some ads also promoted legitimate events such as free legal help for immigrants and free self defence classes, and one appeared to be pushing a pro-Beyoncé rally. Another in the days after the election encouraged Trump supporters to demonstrate outside Trump Tower in New York, where opponents were protesting. Ads and other social media posts by the Internet Research Agency, working in St Petersburg, reached almost 150m users of Facebook and Instagram. Some 13 people linked to the group were indicted by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election, this year. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said the Internet Research Agency had “sought to harness Americans’ very real frustrations and anger over sensitive political matters to influence our thinking, voting and behaviour”. “Sunlight is always the best disinfectant,” Mr Schiff tweeted. “By exposing these Russian-created Facebook advertisements, we hope to better protect legitimate political expression and safeguard Americans from having the information they seek polluted by foreign adversaries.” The publication of the ads comes as the US gears up for midterm elections later this year and other votes are taking place around the world. Facebook has been trying to control the spread of disinformation and prevent foreign influence in elections. This week both Facebook and Google have restricted ads related to the upcoming Irish referendum on abortion. Google has banned all ads related to the poll, while Facebook has banned ads from foreign buyers, as activists abroad sought to influence the vote. Facebook said it had been “too late” to spot the Internet Research Agency’s operation because the company had been focused instead on preventing conventional cyber attacks. “Since then, we’ve made important changes to prevent bad actors from using misinformation to undermine the democratic process,” it said in a blog post. “This will never be a solved problem because we’re up against determined, creative and well-funded adversaries.” Some of the controversial adverts had previously been made public last year, when Congress grilled representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter on Russian interference. The much larger set released on Thursday still includes some redactions by the committee. The largest collection is from the fourth quarter of 2016 when the US presidential election took place. Ads purchased in the days before the vote included one targeting Texans with anti-Hillary Clinton messages, and another targeting people who like Martin Luther King or Malcolm X with ads about pregnant black women being unsafe in their own homes. The ads also show the Internet Research Agency tried to influence US opinion after the presidential election, continuing into the third quarter of 2017 after Facebook announced it had discovered the interference. Each ad was published by the House committee along with the categories the Russian group selected in Facebook’s advertising system for targeting particular users. The categories range from broad ideological stances, such as “conservatism” — it is not made clear how Facebook identifies users as being interested in conservatism — to specific topics or people that users may have followed or liked. For example, one of the last adverts purchased was titled “Secured Borders”, which included an image of a sign saying “Invaders not allowed”, which was targeted at people interested in “deportation” and “illegal immigration” and in the public figures Bill O’Reilly, Julian Assange or Christopher Hitchens. Another ad submitted in 2017 supported Senator Bernie Sanders, showing an image of the former Democratic presidential candidate walking to work under the title “The only politician that doesn’t need to limo to get to work”. The ad does not appear to have been paid for, however, or to have reached anyone, suggesting the Internet Research Agency’s work was stopped mid-campaign."
Meta_1Month,Technology,19 May 2018,The Wall Street Journal,372 words,-0.6808,0.066,0.073,0.862,"A trade group representing news organizations raised concerns in a letter to Facebook Inc. that the company's rules on political ads are overly broad and could affect their ability to promote stories on the social network. The News Media Alliance, whose nearly 2,000 members include Wall Street Journal parent Dow Jones & Co., the New York Times, the Washington Post and many small papers, say Facebook's rules would cause advertisements that promote news stories to be lumped in with political messaging. Facebook's new guidelines, which will go into effect this month, will categorize ad spending on topics such as U.S. poverty, immigration and terrorism as political advertisements. Publishers fear those guidelines would cover ads news organizations purchase to promote articles that touch on those topics, according to the letter. Political ads will be listed in a Facebook archive that will disclose the amount of money spent on ads and the demographics of the audience reached by each ad. In its letter, the group said Facebook's approach ""dangerously blurs the lines between real reporting and propaganda. It is a fundamental mischaracterization of journalism that threatens to undermine its ability to play its critical role in society as the fourth estate."" The letter said forcing publishers to label their promotion of stories as political ads ""will have the effect of elevating less credible news sources on Facebook, the exact opposite of your stated intent."" Facebook's head of news partnerships, Campbell Brown, said that preventing misinformation and interference in elections ""is one of our top priorities."" ""We recognize that news stories about politics are different and we are working with publishers to develop the right approach,"" she added. Facebook's new guidelines for political advertising come as the social-media giant is reeling from successive revelations related to alleged Russian election interference and the improper accessing of data on its users. The letter concludes by calling upon Facebook to ""reconsider its treatment of news in its plan"" and exempt advertisements promoting news stories from its ad-archiving and labeling process. --- Deepa Seetharaman contributed to this article."
Meta_1Month,Technology & Business News: Facebook Near Deals For News Programs,1 June 2018,The Wall Street Journal,410 words,0.8381,0.053,0.02,0.927,"Facebook Inc. is close to announcing a first crop of news shows for its video platform Watch that will likely include content from Fox News and CNN, capping months of turbulent talks and several strategy shifts by the social-media company, people familiar with the matter said. The news programs being negotiated, which would be financed by Facebook and run exclusively on the platform, include one from Fox News hosted by Shepard Smith, some of the people said. A few of the shows could be announced as early as next week and will officially launch in July, other people said. Facebook has been negotiating with a number of big-name media companies and digital upstarts to provide news programming, part of its broader push to help reliable information drown out fabricated articles and rumors on the platform. Facebook has been under pressure since the 2016 election to stamp out misinformation on its site. Executives faced combative questions at the company's annual meeting Thursday on several issues, including fake accounts, data privacy and fabricated news articles. Facebook now is trying to promote what it calls high-quality news, partly through the deals for Watch. As part of the discussions, Facebook staffers have asked some potential partners to detail their ethical standards, including corrections policies, people familiar with the talks said. The news programs are also a way for the social-media giant to drive viewers to Watch, a video-focused portion of Facebook that officially launched last summer. Among the companies still in discussions are News Corp's Dow Jones & Co., parent of The Wall Street Journal, BuzzFeed and digital-media company ATTN, people familiar with the matter said. Group Nine Media's NowThis plans to participate but won't begin rolling out programming until later this year, a person familiar with the matter said. A spokeswoman for CNN, a unit of Time Warner Inc., declined to comment. Fox News didn't return a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Dow Jones declined to comment. 21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership. The discussions between Facebook and some publishers started in late February, some of the people said.

Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that worked for President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, is shutting down following allegations about its misuse of Facebook data and the campaign tactics it pitched to clients. In March, the company suspended its chief executive , Alexander Nix, and said it was launching an independent investigation to determine if the company engaged in any wrongdoing in its work on political campaigns. The company decided to close its doors because it was losing clients and facing mounting legal fees in the Facebook investigation, according to people familiar with the matter. SCL Group and SCL Elections, which are affiliated with Cambridge Analytica, also are shutting down in the U.S. and the U.K. Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections issued a joint statement on Wednesday confirming the companies' closures. ""Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations,"" the statement said. ""The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers. As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business."" The company also said that ""parallel bankruptcy proceedings"" would commence for Cambridge Analytica and ""certain of the company's U.S. affiliates."" Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group's leadership also are involved in a variety of other entities, leaving open the possibility that the companies could rebrand their operations under a different name. Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections combined had close to 100 employees in 2017, according to two people familiar with the matter. The moves followed the release of a video that depicted Mr. Nix describing to people posing as potential clients campaign tactics such as entrapping political opponents with bribes and sex. The sales pitch was captured by undercover journalists at British broadcaster Channel 4. Mr. Nix's suspension also follows media reports that the company gathered data from millions of Facebook Inc. user profiles without authorization. Facebook said data from as many as 87 million of its users may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. In a conference call on Wednesday, Julian Wheatland, SCL chairman, told employees that the firm was shutting down, effective Wednesday, and that employees should turn in their computers, according to a person familiar with the matter. He also said the company's independent investigation into whether Cambridge Analytica used the entrapment tactics Mr. Nix cited in the Channel 4 video had concluded and had ""cleared"" the company, the person said. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing in the Facebook incident. The company said in the Wednesday statement that despite the efforts to correct the record, it ""has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas."" Ahead of the conference call on Wednesday—which was rescheduled more than a half a dozen times since Monday—Cambridge Analytica employees appeared to anticipate the news that was coming: On internal Slack chats, employees exchanged Spotify playlists featuring songs with titles such as ""Help!"" by The Beatles and ""The End"" by The Doors, according to the person familiar with the matter. The business had $15 million in U.S. political work in the 2016 election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission records. Since the 2016 campaign, Cambridge Analytica hadn't notched a single U.S. federal political client; it lost several commercial clients in recent months, according to FEC records and people familiar with the matter. The company lost one longstanding client, the John Bolton Super PAC, when Mr. Bolton became the White House national security adviser and the super PAC suspended its operations last month. Mr. Bolton's super PAC had paid Cambridge Analytica more than $1.2 million between 2014 and 2016, according to FEC records. A person with knowledge of the company's current moves said no client wanted to do business with the company anymore. ""It was just not worth continuing,"" the person said. Cambridge Analytica had tried to rebrand and regroup but the shareholders rejected the plan and didn't want to take on the legal liabilities associated with it, according to the person. Cambridge Analytica didn't respond to a request to comment on this. Cambridge Analytica first broke into American politics in 2013 as the offshoot of British behavioral company SCL Group. The company, which had attracted backing from the Mercer family, was known for its financing of conservative candidates. Rebekah Mercer and her sister Jennifer, daughters of hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, were on the company's board. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon also served on the board before joining the White House. Three Republican presidential campaigns—those of Mr. Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz and neurosurgeon Ben Carson—hired the firm. Even before the reports that Cambridge Analytica had improperly used Facebook data, U.S. clients had said they were dissatisfied with the U.K.-based company's services. Representatives of both the Trump and Cruz campaigns said the company overpromised its ability to use ""psychographic"" data to identify and persuade voters. On the same day in March that Facebook said it would suspend Cambridge Analytica from buying ads after learning that the data firm had improperly harvested Facebook's data, Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer joined the board of a new company, Emerdata Ltd. , based at the same address as Cambridge Analytica's British affiliate, according to a British corporate filing.

Meta_1Month,Tech,24 May 2018,WSJ Pro Cybersecurity,694 words,0.9785,0.092,0.055,0.852,"English , Inc. PARIS—French President Emmanuel Macron ratcheted up demands on U.S. tech giants Thursday by calling on them to embrace European regulations, ranging from taxation to privacy to artificial intelligence, because Washington is failing to do so. ""The U.S. model is no longer sustainable because there is no political accountability,"" Mr. Macron told at a tech conference in Paris just hours before Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg took the same stage. Mr. Zuckerberg, who had met Wednesday with Mr. Macron, struck a conciliatory tone during his appearance, saying the tech sector is now ""making sure we take more responsibility,"" and said that Europe's new GDPR privacy law, which goes into effect on Friday, can help ""increase public trust that these systems are working."" Mr. Zuckerberg added that, in recent weeks, ""the vast majority of people choose to opt in"" when Facebook has asked them to approve its use of their use of internet browsing and application usage data to show them targeted ads. Mr. Macron's broadside—which he began by saying, ""I will be very blunt with you""—is part of a broader political backlash in Europe and elsewhere against the power and influence of a handful of global tech titans. Detractors accuse the firms of a litany of offenses including contributing to income inequality by concentrating wealth and helping undermine democratic discourse with social media tools. Mr. Macron has appointed himself—and France—as a mediator that can find a common ground between the companies and their critics. On one hand, Mr. Macron has wooed investments from tech firms with tax cuts and business-friendly reforms of labor laws. But he has also encouraged them to take more responsibility—inviting some 50 CEOs from firms including Uber Technologies Inc., Microsoft Corp, and International Business Machines Corp. to a summit on Wednesday that he called ""Tech for Good."" In his comments Thursday, Mr. Macron sought to draw a line between what he described as authoritarian rule with few social protections in China, and a U.S. model that he says has abdicated responsibility for Western social values. ""What is at stake is how we build a European model reconciling innovation and the common good. That's our challenge,"" he said. Mr. Zuckerberg, for his part, indicated that he has been studying governance models, including the idea of due process, in an effort to make Facebook more accountable to its users. Under pressure from governments to remove extremist content and hate speech, Facebook plans to introduce features allowing individuals to appeal those removals, including appeals to an outside panel of people who do not work for Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg said. ""What I'd like to get to is to have somewhat of a supreme court, or a higher appellate court that's more independent,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said. One complaint Mr. Macron repeatedly made was some big tech firms not paying enough income tax, by using legal structures to shift profits to lower-tax countries. He said he would continue to fight for a French proposal that the European Union levy a tax on large tech firms' digital revenue in order to level the playing field—even though the proposal has had trouble garnering the unanimity among EU nations that it would need to become law. ""You created a huge wave disrupting sectors of the economy,"" Mr. Macron told the tech executives in the audience. ""That's why I am a strong supporter for this European digital tax for big players and I will fight for it to the end. I think it's fair.""

Meta_1Month,"Access Denied: In Facebook, Federal Court Rejects Taxpayer Right To Appeals",24 May 2018,Mondaq Business Briefing,"1,563 words",-0.8776,0.056,0.067,0.876,"(c) 2018 Mondaq Ltd The US District Court for the Northern District of California on May 14 rejected Facebook's argument that taxpayers have a right to be referred to the IRS Office of Appeals after a case has been brought in US Tax Court. The implications of this decision for taxpayers are significant, and will likely embolden the Internal Revenue Service as it increasingly seeks to unilaterally limit taxpayer access to Appeals to those cases that the IRS itself deems appropriate—​potentially forcing taxpayers into costly litigation. In its decision, the court dismissed Facebook's complaint alleging that the government's decision to deny access to the IRS Office of Appeals (Appeals) constituted a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The court held that Facebook had no guaranteed right to be referred to Appeals and thus lacked standing to bring its action in the first place. The court then summarily dismissed Facebook's complaint. Background The IRS audit of Facebook's 2008-2010 tax years (with 2010 currently before the Tax Court) commenced in 2011. Over the course of that audit, Facebook agreed to extend the statute of limitations five times. Before consenting to extend a sixth time, however, Facebook sought an agreement from the IRS that it would issue a ""30-day letter"" giving Facebook the opportunity to appeal the IRS adjustments to Appeals. The IRS rejected Facebook's request and, in July 2016, issued a notice of deficiency claiming that Facebook had understated the value of intangible property it had licensed to its Ireland subsidiary by billions of dollars. In response, Facebook petitioned the Tax Court to contest the deficiency. In March 2017, however, the IRS advised Facebook that it was refusing to transfer settlement authority over the case to Appeals, citing IRS authority to block access when, in the agency's view, a transfer to Appeals was not in the interest of ""sound tax administration."" In November 2017, Facebook sought a writ of mandamus from the Northern District of California to order the IRS to refer the matter to Appeals. In its complaint, Facebook alleged that the government's denial of access to Appeals constituted a violation of the APA. Facebook further argued that the decision infringed on its right to an independent administrative resolution of the case as provided under the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TBOR). The IRS filed a motion to dismiss Facebook's lawsuit, claiming the ""unilateral ability"" to deny a taxpayer access to Appeals in any docketed case under Rev. Proc. 2016-22, 2016-15 IRB 577. The IRS asserted that Facebook had attempted to invent an entirely new right—the right to an independent administrative forum—that did not previously exist. The IRS, therefore, contended that TBOR did not grant taxpayers any new right to Appeals. Appeals As the court described in its opinion, Appeals was established in 1927, and Congress subsequently mandated its existence in 1998 as part of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA).1 The mission of Appeals is ""[t]o resolve tax controversies, without litigation, on a basis that is fair and impartial to both the government and the taxpayer in a manner that will enhance voluntary compliance and public confidence in the integrity and efficiency of the Service.""2 While the IRS had issued guidance previously asserting that it had discretion to deny certain taxpayers access to Appeals, two years following the enactment of the RRA, the IRS issued further guidance reasserting that it still had discretion to deny access to Appeals.3 In Rev. Proc. 2016-22, the IRS reaffirmed its discretion to deny access to Appeals following the enactment of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act.4 In legislation proposed in the Taxpayer First Act (TFA) dated March 26, 2018, Congress proposed legislation establishing the IRS ""Independent Office of Appeals."" In so doing, Congress noted that, while the IRS ""initially established an independent process, over time the agency increasingly exercised its discretion to withhold certain taxpayers from accessing the review process."" In drafting the proposed legislation, Congress sought to ""ensure that generally all taxpayers are able to access the administrative review process, allowing for their cases to be heard by an independent decision maker. For the first time, this provision codifies the IRS Independent Office of Appeals and provides for additional Congressional oversight over decisions to withhold taxpayers from the administrative review process."" Taxpayer Bill of Rights TBOR was codified in 2015 as part of the PATH Act. Specifically, Section 7803(a)(3) provides, in part, that ""[i]n discharging his duties, the Commissioner shall ensure that employees of the Internal Revenue Service are familiar with and act in accord with taxpayer rights as afforded by other provisions of this title, including . . . the right to appeal a decision of the Internal Revenue Service in an independent forum."" In Facebook's view, Section 7803(a)(3) granted it the right to access Appeals as a matter of law. Facebook pointed to language taken from the Taxpayer Advocate's website—specifically, that ""[t]axpayers are entitled to a fair and impartial administrative appeal of most IRS decisions, including many penalties, and have the right to receive a written response regarding the Office of Appeals decision. Taxpayers generally have the right to take their cases to court""—as reflecting congressional intent in enacting the statute. Facebook, further, contended that the IRS's bald rejection of Facebook's right to Appeals as ""not in the interest of sound tax administration"" was arbitrary and capricious rulemaking in violation of the APA. The IRS, for its part, had argued that the omission from the statute of the above-referenced Taxpayer Advocate language constituted a rejection of that language. The IRS, further, argued that the introductory sentence to Section 7803(a)(3) represented a limitation on the 10 rights that followed the introductory sentence, including ""the right to appeal a decision of the Internal Revenue Service in an independent forum."" In the government's view, the fact that Congress included the prefatory sentence in the statute—rather than merely listing the 10 rights—indicates that the TBOR, rather than establishing new taxpayer rights, merely restates rights that already existed. Thus, in the government's view, TBOR's codification as part of the PATH Act changed nothing, and the IRS still retained the ability to deny taxpayer access to Appeals at its discretion. The Court's Ruling On May 14, 2018, the court granted the IRS motion to dismiss Facebook's complaint. In so doing, US Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler first stated that ""[t]axpayers did not have an enforceable right to take tax cases to IRS Appeals before the 2015 PATH Act and the statutory enactment of a TBOR."" Nor did TBOR's enactment, in Judge Beeler's view, grant taxpayers an independent basis for a substantive right to appeal. Further, even if TBOR had granted taxpayers new substantive rights to appeal, the court found, Facebook still failed to establish ""that the TBOR right on which it relies—'the right to appeal a decision of the Internal Revenue Service in an independent forum,' 26 U.S.C. § 7803(a)(3)(E)—refers to a right to take its tax case to IRS Appeals, as opposed to another independent forum such as the Tax Court."" In rejecting Facebook's argument that the IRS's issuance of Rev. Proc. 2016-22 was ""arbitrary, capricious, [and] an abuse of discretion"" that violated the APA, the court held that Rev. Proc. 2016-22 was not a ""final agency action"" to which the APA applied in the first instance. Rather, the court found, Rev. Proc. 2016-22 ""is an internal procedural rule that does not create or determine any rights, obligations, or legal consequences."" The court further determined that ""[t]he IRS's decision not to refer Facebook's tax case to IRS Appeals similarly is not a final agency action because it is not an action 'by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.'"" Takeaways The implications of the court's decision for taxpayers are significant. Access to Appeals presents a valuable opportunity for taxpayers to resolve disputes with the IRS short of litigation that is lengthy and costly to both taxpayers and the government. A Facebook victory would have represented a significant victory for the taxpayer community in stemming the apparent assault on Appeals from within the IRS. The court's decision will likely embolden the IRS as it increasingly seeks to limit taxpayer access to Appeals to only those cases that the IRS itself deems unilaterally appropriate, and, thus, could force taxpayers into undertaking more and more costly litigation to have its grievances against the government fairly and fully heard.

Technology Experts trawl for evidence of third-party access and misuse of information Facebook has kicked about 200 apps off the platform as part of its investigation into third-party apps with access to user data after the Cambridge Analytica privacy breach highlighted the extensive access developers had to individuals' information. The technology company said yesterday it had looked into thousands of apps as part of a probe into developers that were able to tap into Facebook 's vast data reserves before a change in 2015 restricted what they could access. Ime Archibong, vice-president of product partnerships at Facebook, said the company had suspended ""around 200"" apps ""pending a thorough investigation into whether they did in fact misuse any data"" since the audit was launched by chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in March. The investigation is split into two parts: identifying suspicious behaviour such as large downloads of data; and looking to see whether the data itself was misused. Mr Archibong said Facebook had ""large teams"" of internal and external experts working on the probe. ""Where we find evidence that these or other apps did misuse data, we will ban them and notify people,"" he wrote in a blog post. Facebook has been making more changes to restrict developers' access to data, from reducing the amount of user information that is available through its ""Facebook login"" product — which allows users to sign in to websites using their Facebook ID — to stopping data flowing to apps that a user has not opened in three months. The social network temporarily stopped all new apps from accessing the platform in the wake of revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a UK-based data analytics firm that worked for Donald Trump 's presidential election campaign, may have had improper access to records of up to 87m Facebook users. The company is focusing on investigating apps that were on the platform before 2015 because that is when it made a change to stop developers being able to access data on all of a user's Facebook friends. It was this feature that enabled Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who sold the user data to Cambridge Analytica, to access data on millions of users even though only about 200,000 used his survey app. Facebook has not yet been able to investigate whether Cambridge Analytica deleted the data as it had promised it would in late 2015. The social network attempted to launch its own audit into Cambridge Analytica but was asked to step back by the UK Information Commissioner's Office , which is now probing the company's servers. Cambridge Analytica shut down earlier this month, blaming a ""media siege"" but concerns have been raised that it could reopen as part of a newer company called Emerdata.

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. Technology Facebook has been accused of operating an ""anti-competitive bait and switch scheme"" that misled tens of thousands of developers in order to meet revenue forecasts in its first years as a public company. The lawsuit filed in northern California by app developer Six4Three alleges that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook chief executive, and several senior executives ""weaponised"" user data to gain an advantage over competitors. The plaintiff is pushing for confidential emails to be revealed, which it claims provide evidence of the scheme. A judge will decide whether to unseal the documents in July. Facebook said in a statement that it would ""continue to defend ourselves vigorously"". ""When we changed our policy in 2015, we gave all third-party developers ample notice of material platform changes that could have impacted their application,"" a spokesperson said. The company noted that it attempted to work with the developer who rejected all of its suggestions. The social network said there was no basis in fact for claims that certain apps received special treatment because they bought advertising. In January, Six4Three alleged in a filing that Facebook threatened to shut down developers' access to data unless companies sold themselves to the social network at prices below their fair market value, bought large amounts of unrelated advertising with the company, transferred intellectual property to Facebook and fed all of its data back to the tech group. Six4Three developed an app called Pikinis that filtered a Facebook users' friends photos to find pictures of them in swimwear. The company, which had a beta version on platform, says it was never able to launch the full version because Facebook closed off access to the lists of a users' friends and permission to access their profiles. It is claiming damages for breach of contract including the loss of investment and time spent developing the technology. The company lodged its original complaint in 2015. The lawsuit covers the period between 2012 and 2015. The plaintiffs linked the alleged scheme to Facebook's financial problems after its stock dropped following its May 2012 initial public offering. ""Zuckerberg personally lost approximately $10bn in the period during which he decided to implement the fraudulent and anti-competitive schemes,"" the complaint alleged. ""After Zuckerberg decided upon and implemented the alleged fraudulent and anti-competitive schemes, the downward trajectory of Facebook's stock reversed course and began its rapid climb."" Facebook's shares fell after glitches on the first day of trading and concerns the company would not meet its projections because users were switching to the mobile app faster than advertisers were moving to buying advertisements on smartphones. The lawsuit alleges that Mr Zuckerberg wanted to remove ""competitive threats to Facebook's planned products and propping up Facebook's mobile advertising business by holding software companies hostage""."
Meta_1Month,National-Economy,1 May 2018,Washington Post.com,"1,357 words",0.9243,0.074,0.051,0.875,"Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  SAN FRANCISCO — The billionaire chief executive of WhatsApp, Jan Koum, is planning to leave the company after clashing with its parent, Facebook, over the popular messaging service's strategy and Facebook's attempts to use its personal data and weaken its encryption, according to people familiar with internal discussions. Koum, who sold WhatsApp to Facebook for more than $19 billion in 2014, also plans to step down from Facebook's board of directors, according to these people. The date of his departure isn't known. It ""is time for me to move on,"" Koum wrote in a Facebook post after The Washington Post reported his plans to depart. He has been informing senior executives at Facebook and WhatsApp of his decision, and in recent months has been showing up less frequently to WhatsApp's offices on Facebook's campus in Silicon Valley, according to the people. The independence and protection of its users' data is a core tenet of WhatsApp that Koum and his co-founder, Brian Acton, promised to preserve when they sold their tiny start-up to Facebook. It doubled down on its pledge by adding encryption in 2016. The clash over data took on additional significance in the wake of revelations in March that Facebook had allowed third parties to mishandle its users' personal information. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg replied to Koum's post by crediting Koum with teaching him ""about encryption and its ability to take power from centralized systems and put it back in people's hands. Those values will always be at the heart of WhatsApp."" Facebook, though, needs to prove that its investment in WhatsApp — its largest acquisition ever — was worth it. ""Part of Facebook's success has been to digest acquisitions, successfully monetize them, and integrate them into their advertising machine,"" said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for research firm GBH Insights. But WhatsApp has been more challenging because of resistance from the founders, he said. ""This was a massive culture clash."" Koum's exit is highly unusual at Facebook. The inner circle of management, as well as the board of directors, has been fiercely loyal during the scandals that have rocked the social media giant. In addition, Koum is the sole founder of a company acquired by Facebook to serve on its board. Only two other Facebook executives, Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, are members of the board. Facebook declined to comment on the reasons for Koum's departure but didn't dispute the accounts. In his Facebook post, Koum said he would take some time off from technology to focus on other pursuits, ""such as collecting rare air-cooled Porsches, working on my cars and playing ultimate frisbee."" Acton left the company in November. He has joined a chorus of former executives critical of Facebook. Acton recently endorsed a #DeleteFacebook social media campaign that has gained force in the wake of the controversy over data privacy sparked by Cambridge Analytica, a political marketing firm tied to the Trump campaign that had inappropriately obtained the private information of 87 million Facebook users. Though the Cambridge Analytica revelations contributed to a climate of broader frustration with Facebook among WhatsApp employees, Koum made his decision to leave before the scandal, the people said. WhatsApp, with 1.5 billion monthly users, is the largest messaging service in the world. It is most popular in countries such as India, Egypt and Brazil, as well as in Europe, where it is used for phone calls and text messaging with friends and businesses, as well as news distribution and group chats. Koum and Acton, former co-workers at Yahoo, founded WhatsApp in 2009. It promised private communications for 99 cents a year. By 2014, the tiny company had almost 500 million users. It caught the attention of Zuckerberg, who was looking to expand the social network overseas. After a dinner at Zuckerberg's house, Zuckerberg made an offer for WhatsApp that turned Acton and Koum into instant billionaires. But even in the early days, there were signs of a mismatch. WhatsApp had less than $20 million in revenue at the time of the acquisition. Facebook was making billions of dollars by selling advertisers access to its users, on whom it had collected large amounts of information. Koum and Acton were openly disparaging of the targeted advertising model. In a WhatsApp blog post in 2012, they wrote that ""no one wakes up excited to see more advertising; no one goes to sleep thinking about the ads they'll see tomorrow."" They described online advertising as ""a disruption to aesthetics, an insult to your intelligence, and the interruption of your train of thought."" The WhatsApp co-founders were also big believers in privacy. They took pains to collect as little data as possible from their users, requiring only phone numbers and putting them at odds with data-hungry Facebook. At the time of the acquisition, Koum and Acton said Facebook had assured them that WhatsApp could remain an independent service and would not share its data with Facebook. How and if WhatsApp would make money was left an open question. ""WhatsApp will remain autonomous and operate independently,"" the founders wrote in a blog post announcing the acquisition. ""And you can still count on absolutely no ads interrupting your communication."" Eighteen months later, the promise not to share data evaporated. Facebook pushed WhatsApp to change its terms of service to give the social network access to the phone numbers of WhatsApp users, along with analytics such as what devices and operating systems people were using. WhatsApp executives were comfortable sharing some data with Facebook to measure who was using the service, according to the people. But they opposed using WhatsApp's data to create a user profile that was unified across Facebook's multiple platforms, which also include Instagram and Facebook Messenger, and that could be used for ad-targeting or for Facebook's data-mining. Acton and Koum acquiesced, enabling Facebook to recommend that users' WhatsApp contacts become their Facebook friends and making it possible for Facebook to collect more data about those relationships. The changes also allowed advertisers to feed lists of phone numbers into Facebook's advertising system, known as Custom Audience, and find new people to target with ads. Last year, the European Commission, the European Union's regulatory authority, fined Facebook $122 million for making ""misleading"" statements when the E.U. approved the WhatsApp takeover. Conflicts soon arose over how WhatsApp would make money. Facebook scrapped the 99-cent annual charge, and Koum and Acton continued to oppose the advertising model. The service still has no ads, but WhatsApp has embarked on experiments to make money: In January, Facebook rolled out a tool, called WhatsApp Business, to allow businesses to create a profile and send messages to their customers on WhatsApp. The founders also clashed with Facebook over building a mobile payments system on WhatsApp in India. Another point of disagreement was over WhatsApp's encryption. In 2016, WhatsApp added end-to-end encryption, a security feature that scrambles people's messages so that outsiders, including WhatsApp's owners, can't read them. Facebook executives wanted to make it easier for businesses to use its tools, and WhatsApp executives believed that doing so would require some weakening of its encryption. Ultimately, Koum was worn down by the differences in approach, the people said. Other WhatsApp employees are demoralized and plan to leave in November, four years and a month after the Facebook acquisition, when they are allowed to exercise all their stock options under the terms of the Facebook deal, according to the people. Acton donated $50 million of his money to Signal, a rival messaging app that is geared toward security and privacy. In a recent blog post announcing his donation and role as the executive chairman of the nonprofit Signal Foundation, Acton said his goal was to build ""the most trusted communications experience on the planet."" elizabeth.dwoskin@washpost.com Julie Tate contributed to this report."

SAN FRANCISCO - Jan Koum, the billionaire co-founder and CEO of WhatsApp, says he's leaving Facebook. ""It is time for me to move on,"" Koum wrote in a Facebook post of his decision to resign from the Silicon Valley company, which bought WhatsApp four years ago. ""I've been blessed to work with such an incredibly small team and see how a crazy amount of focus can produce an app used by so many people all over the world. "" Koum will not stand for re-election to Facebook's board of directors, the company said in a securities filing. The decision to leave was driven by disagreements over Facebook's use of personal data and attempts to weaken the service's use of encryption, according to the Washington Post, which cited people familiar with internal discussions. Facebook declined to comment. It's unclear who will replace Koum at the helm of WhatsApp or on the Facebook board. In a comment on Koum's Facebook post, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote: ""I'm grateful for everything you've done to help connect the world, and for everything you've taught me, including about encryption and its ability to take power from centralized systems and put it back in people's hands. "" Zuckerberg concluded by saying: ""Those values will always be at the heart of WhatsApp. "" Revelations that 87 million users had their data improperly obtained by Cambridge Analytica, the British political firm with ties to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, has shaken consumer confidence in Facebook. The resignation of a prominent leader and board member is the latest blow to Facebook, which has taken a public beating for its handling of people's private information in recent weeks. During two marathon congressional hearings earlier this month, lawmakers pressed Zuckerberg on whether Facebook's 2. 2 billion users really own and control their data and what, if anything, they can do to protect it. Asked Rep. Janice Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat: ""Who’s going to protect us from Facebook?"" The New York Times reported that Koum was alarmed by the vast amount of data that Facebook collects and had pushed for stronger measures to protect that data. When Koum and Brian Acton sold WhatsApp to Facebook in 2014 for more than $19 billion, they pledged to protect users' data, adding encryption in 2016 so that the messaging service, unlike Facebook, collects very little in the way of personal information from its users. Acton left the company in November and recently urged people to join the #DeleteFacebook movement on social media. WhatsApp explains how encryption works on its website: ""Privacy and security is in our DNA, which is why we have end-to-end encryption. When end-to-end encrypted, your messages, photos, videos, voice messages, documents, status updates and calls are secured from falling into the wrong hands. "" Facebook paid a steep price for a mobile app with negligible revenue that, while widely used internationally, was less known in the United States. Yet its startling growth, faster even than Facebook's own in its early years, caught Zuckerberg's attention. Zuckerberg, determined to break into the growing mobile messaging market by betting on a promising new player, had tried and failed to buy Snapchat. Since he bought WhatsApp, it has more than tripled its user count to 1. 5 billion. Koum, a self-taught programmer and college dropout, created the messaging app in 2009 with his one-time Yahoo colleague Acton. One of the main reasons the fiercely independent Koum agreed to the Facebook acquisition was to get the freedom to concentrate on building features and growing the audience without having to worry too much about making money. Wall Street swallowed the acquisition, hoping it would eventually create a new revenue source for Facebook. Koum is famously averse to advertising, the money-minting machine for Facebook and its photo-sharing service Instagram. In 2012, he and Acton published a pledge to never become ""just another ad clearinghouse. "" A key selling point for WhatsApp users: ""end to end"" encryption so that only the sender and receiver can read messages or see photos and videos. ""We built it because our users all over the world would write in and want more privacy and more security in the product,"" Koum told USA TODAY two years ago. ""It may not be not a large segment of our users. But when you are working on our scale, even 1%, 2% or 3% of users, that's a large number and we want them all to be able to use our product. "" Koum and Acton were told WhatsApp would not have to run ads or provide user data to Facebook. But soon Facebook pressured WhatsApp to change its privacy policy to share users' phone numbers and other information with its parent company, alarming European regulators. Last year, the European Union fined Facebook $122 million for making “misleading” statements when it approved the WhatsApp takeover. In March, WhatsApp agreed to stop sharing data with Facebook until the two companies could do so in compliance with stricter European Union privacy rules taking effect in May. Tensions continued to boil over how WhatsApp would make money. Facebook had nixed the $1 a year subscription charge that Koum and Acton favored and the WhatsApp founders continued to oppose ads. In January, Facebook introduced a tool, WhatsApp Business, which allows businesses to create a profile and send messages to customers on WhatsApp. And, according to the Washington Post, Facebook executives wanted to make it easier for businesses to use WhatsApp tools, which meant weakening some of the messaging service's encryption. Other WhatsApp employees also plan to leave in November, when they are allowed to exercise all of their stock options, according to the newspaper. After the news broke of Koum's resignation, technology entrepreneur Anil Dash wrote on Twitter: ""There's probably no tech deal that's had more potential negative impact globally than when WhatsApp sold out to Facebook. They had a sustainable, independent business model, no ads, and a small, efficient team. Now?"" More: Facebook's annual conference is big test for Mark Zuckerberg More: Facebook wants to save your face. Should you say yes to facial recognition? More: After Facebook hearings, users want to know: who is protecting my data? The publicity shy Koum rarely grants interviews but he does have nearly 90,000 people on Facebook who follow his posts, many of which are pro-Trump and pro-Israel as well as anti-immigration links. He also has expressed an interest in ""air cooled"" Porsche sports cars, including in Monday's note bidding farewell to Facebook. ""I'm taking some time off to do things I enjoy outside of technology, such as collecting rare air-cooled Porsches, working on my cars and playing ultimate frisbee,"" he wrote. His WhatsApp co-founder, Acton, has donated $50 million to Signal, a messaging app that emphasizes security and privacy, and taken on the role of executive chairman of the non-profit Signal Foundation, whose mission is to develop technology that protects free expression. ""As more and more of our lives happen online, data protection and privacy are critical. This isn’t just important for select people in select countries. It’s important for people from all walks of life in every part of the world. Everyone deserves to be protected,"" Acton said. ""Our plan is to pioneer a new model of technology nonprofit focused on privacy and data protection for everyone, everywhere. """

Meta_1Month,A Busy Month In The Facebook Photo Tagging Biometric Privacy Dispute,1 June 2018,Mondaq Business Briefing,"1,453 words",-0.9689,0.037,0.076,0.888,"(c) 2018 Mondaq Ltd As discussed in past posts about the long-running Facebook biometric privacy class action, users are challenging Facebook's ""Tag Suggestions"" program, which scans for and identifies people in uploaded photographs for photo tagging. The class alleges that Facebook collected and stored their biometric data without prior notice or consent in violation of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/1 et seq. While other technology companies face BIPA actions over photo tagging functions, In Re Facebook is the headliner of sorts for BIPA litigation, being the most closely-watched and fully-litigated. There have been a host of new developments in this case as the parties continued to joust when the prospect of a trial was looming. Earlier this month, a California district court denied both parties' motions for summary judgment and found that a ""multitude of factual disputes"" barred judgment as a matter of law for either side. (In re Facebook Biometric Information Privacy Litig., No. 15-03747 (N.D. Cal. May 14, 2018)). The court's prior orders over the past several years provide the context for the denial of summary judgment and the court's refusal to revisit procedural rulings. See: In re Facebook Biometric Info. Privacy Litig., 185 F. Supp. 3d 1155 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (declining to enforce California choice of law provision in user agreement and applying Illinois law and refusing to find that the text of BIPA excludes from its scope all information involving photographs); Patel v. Facebook Inc., 290 F. Supp. 3d 948 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (declining to dismiss based on lack of Article III standing); In re Facebook Biometric Info. Privacy Litig., No. 15-03747, 2018 WL 1794295 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 16, 2018) (certifying Illinois user class and refusing Facebook's renewed arguments to dismiss on procedural grounds). On May 29, 2018, the trial judge again attempted to spur the matter onto trial when it denied Facebook's request to stay the proceedings while it seeks interlocutory review from the Ninth Circuit of the court's order certifying a class for trial. Read together with these prior rulings, the court's latest decisions had the overarching tone of ""Enough already."" However, on the same day, the Ninth Circuit issued a one-page order agreeing to accept Facebook's interlocutory appeal of the trial court's order granting class certification and stay the lower court proceedings (Patel v. Facebook, Inc., No. 18-80053 (9th Cir. May 29, 2018)). As a result, the July trial date has been vacated and we will be watching how the Ninth Circuit examines the class certification issue, which may prompt the appeals court to look anew at certain hotly-contested procedural arguments that have already been the subject of multiple motions in the lower court. Some Noteworthy Aspects of the May 14th Ruling Denying Summary Judgment ""Actual"" Injury: The lower court again rebuffed Facebook's interpretation of the Illinois appellate court decision in Rosenbach that a litigant had to ""prove something more than a violation of BIPA's notice-and-consent provisions"" to prevail - that is, show an ""actual"" injury beyond the invasion of privacy rights outlined under BIPA. The court noted that it had already ""expressly rejected"" this argument in its April decision, finding Rosenbach did not carry as much weight as Facebook suggests because that particular plaintiff failed to plead any harm or injury to a privacy right, as opposed to the instant case where the plaintiffs ""sufficiently alleged"" an intangible injury. Face Scanning Technology: The court found too many factual disagreements about Facebook's face recognition functions to warrant a ruling on summary judgment to either party. Plaintiffs' case rests largely on whether Facebook collects and stores ""scans of face geometry"" as envisioned under BIPA (the definition of ""biometric identifiers"" under BIPA includes ""scan[s] of . . . face geometry""), and the parties have advanced conflicting interpretations of how the software at issue processes human faces from photographs. Plaintiffs argued that the technology collects scans of face geometry because it uses human facial regions to process and recognize face images. Facebook countered that the technology is not reliant on human facial features but uses machine learning techniques that analyze all of the pixels in a face image and not any particularly human feature to accomplish facial recognition (according to Facebook's expert, the technology would still calculate a ""face signature'"" even if provided with an image of something other than a face). Facebook even argued that the BIPA statutory term ""scan"" in ""scan of face geometry"" necessarily connotes an express measurement of human facial features, and that its technology does not scan face geometry. However, the court ruled that the term ""scan"" does not necessarily demand ""actual or express measurements"" and that genuine issues of fact over Facebook's facial recognition technology would need to be resolved at trial. BIPA Photograph Exclusion: The court reiterated that it had already considered at an earlier stage and rejected Facebook's argument that BIPA regulates only in-person or ""live"" scans of facial geometry, and that information derived from photographs, whether analog or digital, is categorically excluded from the statute. Dormant Commerce Clause: The court rejected Facebook's argument that subjecting it to BIPA would violate the dormant commerce clause, which applies when a state tries to regulate economic conduct wholly outside its borders with the goal of protecting local businesses from out-of-state competition (note: Facebook claims that it processes facial recognition on servers outside the state of Illinois). The court found enough of a local focus to turn away the argument: ""This lawsuit is under an Illinois state statute on behalf of Illinois residents who used Facebook in Illinois."" Interestingly, the court stated that evidence showed that Facebook can activate or deactivate features for users in specific states when it wants to do so, presumably using geoblocking technology, and thus Facebook would not have to change it practices with respect to users in other states to comply with BIPA. Looking Ahead The Ninth Circuit will soon review the lower court's April 2018 class certification order (note: the class consists of Facebook users located in Illinois for whom Facebook created and stored a face template after June 7, 2011). While a full discussion of the class issues is beyond the scope of this blog post, generally speaking plaintiffs must show, among other things, that there are questions of law or fact common to class members that predominate over any questions affecting only individual members. As seen in the lower court's decision, the class certification analysis has some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff's underlying claim, and it is here where the Ninth Circuit's decision may be interesting. While the parties agreed that the basic question of whether Facebook's facial recognition technology collected biometric identifiers as contemplated under BIPA and whether Facebook followed the requisite notice and consent practices reached the entire class, Facebook had objected to the certification because it believed certain legal issues were not common to the class. Most notably, Facebook contended the issue of whether a class member is ""aggrieved"" as that word is used in BIPA, which grants a private right of action only to ""persons aggrieved"" under it, can be resolved only by individualized evidence and not on a class basis. As such, it seems that the Ninth Circuit may undertake its own review of the Rosenbach decision and whether BIPA's use of the term ""aggrieved"" requires injury or harm beyond the alleged statutory violation. The Ninth Circuit may also rule on Facebook's tangential arguments of extraterritoriality and whether the location of Facebook's servers may be dispositive about whether the bulk of circumstances surrounding the face scanning occurred within Illinois. Whatever the outcome, the appeals court's decision will certainly influence other ongoing biometric privacy litigation over photo tagging practices, and perhaps even the BIPA-related litigation occurring in Illinois state courts against employers and businesses that use biometric technology for customer and employee authentication. We will continue to follow these important developments in this area.

Meta_1Month,Technology,6 May 2018,NYTimes.com Feed,"1,742 words",0.9831,0.062,0.025,0.913,"English .  SAN FRANCISCO — In July 2014, a team of four Swedish and Polish researchers began using an automated program to better understand what people posted on Facebook . The program, known as a “scraper,” let the researchers log every comment and interaction from 160 public Facebook pages for nearly two years. By May 2016, they had amassed enough information to track how 368 million Facebook members behaved on the social network. It is one of the largest known sets of user data ever assembled from Facebook . “We’re concerned about how easy it was to collect this,” said Fredrik Erlandsson, one of the researchers and a lecturer at the Blekinge Institute of Technology in Sweden. Last December, he and his colleagues published a research paper in the journal Entropy detailing how their methods of trawling social media sites could be replicated. For more than a decade, professors, doctoral candidates and researchers from academic institutions around the world have harvested information from Facebook using techniques similar to those of Dr. Erlandsson and his team. They have compiled hundreds of Facebook data sets that captured the behavior of a few thousand to hundreds of millions of individuals, according to interviews with more than a dozen scholars. Their practices came to light in March when The New York Times and The Observer of London reported that Aleksandr Kogan, a University of Cambridge psychology professor, had obtained the data of up to 87 million Facebook users through a quiz app. Mr. Kogan sold the information to Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm with ties to the Trump campaign, so it could build psychographic profiles of American voters. Last week, Cambridge Analytica said it would cease operations after the uproar over its use of personal information. But while what happened with Mr. Kogan’s Facebook data set is now known, the fate of other information hoards is murkier. In many cases, the data was used for research or scholarly articles. The information was then sometimes left unsecured and stored on open servers that offered access to anyone. Some academics said the data could have been easily copied and sold to marketers or political consulting firms. The potential result is more leakage of Facebook users’ information through academic circles, said Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, a professor of political communication at the University of Oxford who has studied data collection from Facebook . “The academic world is highly decentralized, and each individual, each institution, has a different way of securing their data,” Dr. Nielsen said. “Even if almost everyone in the academic community is careful and protects the data, you still can end up in a situation where someone is careless or acts in bad faith and sells access. It’s hard to imagine how Facebook stops that from happening.” The Times reviewed half a dozen Facebook data sets compiled by academics from 2006 to 2017. One, gathered from 2015 to 2017 by researchers in Denmark and New Zealand, examined 1.3 million people in Denmark — about a quarter of the country’s population — to determine how liking one political page on Facebook could predict how someone would vote in the future. Another set, from 2013, by a group of Norwegian academics focused on the civic engagement of 21 million Facebook members on four continents. The Danish research team did not respond to a request for comment. Petter Bae Brandtzaeg, one of the Norwegian researchers, said he understood concerns about data gathering. “As a researcher you get immediate access to people’s behavior, attitudes, feelings and relationships, which are of course tempting for all,” he wrote in an email. He said many researchers lacked the technical expertise to properly secure data. The Facebook data was typically amassed through scraper programs that crawled the social network to was posted, or through quiz apps that requested access to people’s profiles. The results included users’ locations, interests, political affiliations, Facebook interactions and even music preferences. In most cases, researchers assigned numbers to people whose Facebook information they had obtained to maintain anonymity. But the more data there is, the easier it is to overlay one information set with another to identify someone. One 2015 paper published in the journal Science looked at credit card spending data and found that data scientists could pinpoint 90 percent of the shoppers by name with just four random pieces of information from sites like Facebook , Instagram and Twitter . Once people are identified and their interests and interactions known, they can be targeted with advertising and mobilized for political campaigns or other causes. For years, Facebook had no specific policies about academics’ access to user data, though it had guidelines on working with third parties. While the company has a rule that forbids the use of scrapers, it has not enforced that policy against scholars. And at times, it has assisted researchers with studies. In 2014, though, Facebook began limiting third-party apps, like quizzes, from obtaining users’ information. Since Mr. Kogan’s actions were revealed, fueling an outcry over data privacy, Facebook has made further changes. The company has given people more control over their privacy settings . It has said it will audit all apps that collected large amounts of Facebook data, and it temporarily stopped allowing new apps to gather information from its members. Last month, Facebook also narrowed the number of academics it would work with, saying it would collaborate with those who wanted to research the impact of social media on elections through an “independent election research commission.” Only scholars with election-related projects can apply. “We are taking a hard look at the information apps can use when you connect them to Facebook , as well as other data practices,” Susan Glick, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement. “These other data practices include academic research.” Before social media existed, researchers hoping to study human behavior had to painstakingly seek out groups of people to examine. Social media has let them easily find masses of subjects — as well as information like their date of birth, gender and interests — and observe some of their online behavior in real time. “It was unprecedented,” said Christian Rudder, a founder of OkCupid, a dating and social media site, who published the book “Dataclysm” in 2014 on how much people revealed through their online lives. One of the academic community’s earliest known Facebook data sets was collected in 2006 by Harvard University professors. It covered 1,700 people who agreed to have their Facebook information anonymously analyzed. The data was later easily traced back by other academics to Harvard freshmen. In Britain, researchers were doing similar work through different means. In 2007, Michal Kosinski, then deputy director at the Psychometrics Center at the University of Cambridge , worked with a colleague, David Stillwell, to create My Personality, a quiz app that offered to assess people’s personalities in exchange for data about them. It was one of the first times a quiz app had been used for obtaining Facebook members’ information. My Personality has now collected details on more than six million Facebook users, according to the academics who have gathered the data. Many researchers have since copied the quiz app method, including Mr. Kogan. In interviews with The Times, Dr. Kosinski and Dr. Stillwell said they took great care to keep the data they procured anonymous. Dr. Stillwell added that the information had been widely shared with other researchers, but any academic who wished to use it was vetted. Dr. Kosinski acknowledged that data is not a physical item that is easy to control. Once a data set is created, it can be copied and shared until its original source is unknown. He said collection of information from Facebook had become widespread over the years, not only by academics but also by developers, marketers, data analytics companies and others. “What Kogan did was wrong. But what Kogan did, many others do on a much larger scale,” Dr. Kosinski said. “They just don’t get caught.” In 2014, after Facebook announced it would restrict third-party apps from gaining access to user data, the reach of quiz apps became limited. But scrapers continued to improve and more speedily compile information from the social network. A group of German academics used a scraper to harvest the profiles of 60,000 Facebook users in the New Orleans area starting in late 2008. The researchers, whose goal was to study how people’s friendships change online over time, recorded over 800,000 interactions during a two-year period. They did not respond to a request for comment. Some scholars said Facebook ’s recent privacy changes may have gone too far by also cutting off academics who behaved responsibly. “Academics would argue that we need access to primary data,” said Dr. Nielsen of Oxford. He said the changes might lead to an asymmetry, with internal Facebook researchers accumulating mounds of data while outside academics would not. “If that happens, only Facebook will really know very much about how Facebook actually operates and how people act on Facebook ,” he said. Dr. Erlandsson said the paper he and his colleagues published last December initially made little splash. But since the Cambridge Analytica revelations, he has seen renewed interest. He said he had been contacted by companies — he declined to name them — interested in buying the data on 368 million Facebook members. “I’m not interested in selling,” he said. “And the truth is, anyone could easily do this themselves.” Follow Sheera Frenkel on Twitter : @sheeraf. * European Regulators Ask if Facebook Is Taking Too Much Data * Audit Approved of Facebook Policies, Even After Cambridge Analytica Leak * Facebook Is Creepy.

Meta_1Month,Media - Business,25 May 2018,English,"1,914 words",0.993,0.115,0.067,0.818,"© 2018 Fairchild Publishing, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media.  Facebook is running something of a mea culpa campaign promising to be more proactive on privacy, fake ads and accounts, but the engine of its profitable empire, advertisers, are still unsure what it all means. “Here together” is the tag for Facebook’s new commercial, which explains in rather sentimental terms that the platform “came here for the friends” but ended up having to “deal with…spam, clickbait, fake news and data misuse.” There are also physical ads popping up explaining that fake accounts are being deleted and, in its first “transparency report,” (which is a little too vague for such a title), it boasted the deletion of 865 million posts during the first quarter that were mainly spam. There’s been almost no talk of advertising, however, and how an industry that’s come to rely on the user insights and easy consumer access Facebook had to offer will be moving forward in light of these changes and others focused on restricting, in some capacity, third-party access to users’ data. For now it seems lack of consumer outcry over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, outside of a few high-profile tweets pushing the deletion of Facebook profiles, which lost any oomph when there was no similar campaign to delete Instagram, seems to be at the crux of an industrywide shrug. Usually brands are quick to pull an ad, be it from a high-profile endorser or a TV program — but it seems not a single brand has left Facebook or Instagram. “I don’t even think we’ve gotten many client questions [about Cambridge Analytica],” Jocelyn Lee, head of media strategy at advertising firm Heat, which also uses Facebook and Instagram as company platforms, said. “Not that [advertisers] aren’t concerned, but they always will go where the audience is. And we’re not seeing audiences leaving these platforms — both are still growing, especially globally. Basically, we’ll go wherever the fish are to fish.” But it’s not just that the audience seems relatively unconcerned with Facebook’s privacy issues, although there is little question that user apathy is the saving grace for its platforms. Lee noted the extreme usefulness of Facebook and Instagram as advertising vehicles and the targeting tools they offer, and more recently as straight sales platforms, that make it painful for brands and advertisers to even think about leaving. Lee mentioned Mansur Gavriel as an example. The popular women’s accessories brand recently held a sample sale in New York, but offered its Instagram followers early online access to a certain number of discounted items if they gave their e-mail. This is part of the still new “opt-in” wave of marketing on Facebook and Instagram and Lee said it works over time if there is a “value exchange” like exclusivity for personal information. “[Mansur Gavriel] was able to capture the e-mails, add to a distribution list and know that this was an opt-in, that people were willing to give it,” Lee noted. But some changes Facebook has made to its platforms in response to apparent privacy issues have advertisers at least taking a good look at what the social giant still has to offer them. The company has reworked its News Feed algorithm to focus less on paid and brand content and more on posts from a user’s “friends” and made its privacy tools, which allow users to control the use of their data to a certain extent, more accessible. Another change was Facebook’s decision to end its “Partner Categories” program, which allows some third-party data companies access to user data, like purchasing activity on other sites after a Facebook/Instagram visit, for the purpose of ad-targeting. And the company has also been blocking some developers from running things like “quizzes” on Facebook, something Cambridge Analytica also did, if the results are gathered up and sold to marketers. Tribe Dynamics, a small firm that analyzes Facebook and Instagram data to calculate earned media value for a host of established beauty brands, said last month that its access to the platform’s application programming interface, better known as API, was cut off unexpectedly. A new system called Graph API is supposed to be on the way, but there’s no time frame for when developers and data companies will again have access. “Protecting people’s information is paramount to our business,” a Facebook spokeswoman said. “We are working hard to rebuild trust with our global community, which includes actions to improve the controls people have on Facebook and transparency around the ads they see. We are thankful for the expressed support from many of our advertising partners around the steps we’re taking to better protect people’s information.” Advertisers may have expressed support for Facebook making user privacy a bigger part of its platform, but it’s not surprising that at least some aren’t overjoyed with the changes. “Wait-and-see is part of it,” Lee said. “Facebook came out with banning third-party sources and that got a lot of pushback and concerns. We’re not trying to sell data, we’re just trying to give a better customer experience with anonymized data. Six years ago, I would be getting ads that had nothing to do with me, like Russian brides or something. I don’t want that experience [again].” Facebook also revealed a “clear history” option is coming for users to clear their browsing history on the platform, something they couldn’t do before, similar to the way one can clear browsing history from a search engine. “It will be a simple control to clear your browsing history on Facebook — what you’ve clicked on, web sites you’ve visited, and so on,” founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a post, while not mentioning that these are key data points for ad-targeting. “Once we roll out this update, you’ll be able to see information about the apps and web sites you’ve interacted with, and you’ll be able to clear this information from your account. You’ll even be able to turn off having this information stored with your account.” Zuckerberg added in the post that his experience last month testifying before Congress showed that he lacked “clear enough answers to some of the questions about data.” He added that Facebook will “have more to come soon” on its privacy controls. While part of this is certainly due to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Europe this month is implementing the General Data Protection Regulation, which places clear and heightened restrictions on how foreign tech giants like Facebook and Google can collect and use people’s data. So Facebook is actually being forced to realign parts of its data strategy. And Zuckerberg made sure to stop by the European Parliament on Tuesday to apologize for Facebook’s failure to “prevent these tools from being used for harm” — although he didn’t give many other detailed answers. “We didn’t take a broad enough view of our responsibility,” he added. “That was a mistake, and I’m sorry for it.” To be sure, all of this is being watched closely by advertisers. Megan Jones, senior director of strategy and service at boutique marketing firm January Digital, said “it’s still really early” but that there are still “a lot of questions.” Jones admitted that part of the reason Facebook and Instagram have become such huge parts of advertising is that the platforms offered so many insights into users. “It was this really cool world with such a unique offering.” But even with changes that may make ad-targeting more challenging, Jones said she has “a hard time believing we’re going to abandon Facebook — as consumers or marketers.” She also remarked how many people seem unaware that Facebook owns Instagram and operates the platform with the same privacy tools and back-end data capabilities. Nevertheless, Jones said “we’re taking a look” at both platforms. “We work with a lot of luxury and beauty brands and we have to be consumer-led, but these issues are becoming so ethical,” Jones added. “We’re going to have to be careful of where we represent ourselves.” As for whether she’s been fielding more calls from competing ad platforms like Google, for instance, looking to move in on Facebook’s territory, Jones said that has always been “just constant.” “We’re always looking at alternatives, but if the consumer behavior doesn’t change, it’s going to be pretty hard as an advertiser to pull our money and go somewhere,” Jones said. And it’s not just advertisers who see no change in the number of people using Facebook and Instagram. Recent research from Strategy Analytics showed that daily minutes of use and market penetration by Facebook “remained consistent before and after the [Cambridge Analytica] event.” Specifically, average daily minutes of use totaled roughly 54.6 minutes, while penetration hovered around 47 percent. Facebook also posted first-quarter gains in users, revenues and profits, the latter of which is almost entirely derived from advertising. Prabhat Agarwal, a director at Strategy Analytics, has a simple, although partial, explanation for the unchanged usage: “There’s just a lack of competition in terms of social media outlets that have the presence globally.” Another factor is that users, like the advertisers who want their data, see genuine “value” in what Facebook’s platforms have to offer. “The core number of users is not going to change,” Agarwal said. “As long as the company makes these privacy adjustments, consumers will continue to find value in it as a platform. Frankly, the short-term spotlight has been reduced, not to say that users and Congress aren’t still paying attention.” And that increased level of scrutiny could have Facebook on something of a ledge with users, advertisers and regulators, should another privacy issue crop up. But it will still take something relatively extreme to get Facebook’s core users to abandon it. “Either a massive data breach or some sort or regulatory agency coming in and saying: ‘We’re going to monitor your data to make sure everything is peachy keen,’” could scare off users, and effectively advertisers, according to Agarwal. Even if one, or both, of those things happened, however, there’s still the fact that Facebook and Instagram seem to have no genuine competition in social media, leaving them with something of a lock on their collective almost three billion active monthly users. But Zuckerberg doesn’t agree with the idea that Facebook has become something akin to a monopoly in the digital age. He told Congress that “the average American uses about eight different apps to communicate and stay connected to people,” but didn’t name any in particular, or mention that at least three Facebook platforms are in that group. In addition to Facebook and Instagram, there’s also the messaging app WhatsApp, which has about one billion active users. So, altogether, Facebook has roughly 60 percent of the global population using one of its three platforms. “There’s a lot of competition that we feel every day,” Zuckerberg told Congress. “That’s an important force that we definitely feel when running the company.” For More, See: Facebook, Instagram Privacy Changes Affect Beauty Brands Going Beyond Sociability, Retailers Get Serious About Business With Instagram Facebook Augments Messenger With AR and More"
Meta_1Month,tech,10 May 2018,USA Today Online,"1,622 words",0.8329,0.086,0.077,0.837,"English Copyright © 2018 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  SAN FRANCISCO - Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released thousands of Russian Facebook ads on Thursday, offering the public its first in-depth look at the troubling messages used to heighten tensions among Americans during and after the 2016 U. S. presidential election. The release of the ads, which Facebook says were purchased by the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency to sway public sentiment, comes as the giant social network races to tighten restrictions on political ads to head off manipulation of upcoming elections, including this fall's hotly contested midterms. Pressure has intensified since the Justice Department charged 13 Russians and three companies in February, exposing a wide-ranging effort to subvert the election and to support the Trump campaign. Facebook pages with points of view that span the political spectrum from ""Blacktivist"" to ""Heart of Texas"" bought ads. Some of the more than 3,000 ads denounced Donald Trump, others his Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton. Many of the ads, placed by Russians posing as Americans, didn't endorse a specific candidate but spread inflammatory messages on sensitive subjects such as immigration and race to amplify fault lines in American life, targeting users from specific backgrounds and tight races in key states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Virginia. These negative appeals included a group called Fit Black, which urged people to attend “Black Fist Free Self-Defense Classes. ” Another from the Army of Jesus encouraged voters to pick a president with “godly morals"" with a picture of Jesus arm-wrestling Satan. The Facebook ads varied in their effectiveness and reach, with some only being shared a few hundred times, others seen hundreds of thousands or more than 1 million times. They ran just over two years starting in June 2015, increasing in volume in October and November 2016, just before and after the presidential election, but also showing spikes in April and May of 2016 and also April and May of 2017. Patterns quickly emerge in sampling the ads. Many of the hundreds of ads placed in April 2016 targeted racial divisions in American society, encouraging African-American political activism by imitating the language and messaging of the Black Lives Matter movement with posts highlighting racist incidents and others the resilience and beauty of the African-American community. A smaller contingent that month targeted conservative Facebook users. Festooned with American flags, they sounded patriotic themes including reverence for the constitution. Still others contained calls for Americans to ""take care of our vets, not illegals. "" Facebook says it has taken a much more aggressive stance on political and issue ads, forcing people who buy them to verify their identity and location and to reveal publicly who they are. Until September, when it identified 470 accounts that purchased 3,000 ads for more than $100,000 over a two-year period, Facebook repeatedly denied the Russians exploited its platform. In fact, Russian operatives availed themselves of the precise nature of the ad targeting offered by Facebook, zeroing in on categories of Facebook users, such as gun lovers, Trump supporters, residents of certain places, and more. They also took advantage of Facebook’s computer algorithms, which at the time favored sensationalist posts that drive more reaction. Ten million Americans saw the ads, Facebook estimates, and 146 million Americans, or nearly half of the U. S. population, may have been reached by content from Russian operatives such as status updates and videos on Facebook and Instagram, also owned by Facebook. The extent of election meddling put Facebook on the defensive and served as a wake-up call for Facebook users, who for years allowed the culling of their personal information in exchange for the free service without much thought to what happens to that data, let alone whether an adversarial foreign power could exploit it to provoke outrage over polarizing issues from gay rights to gun rights. More: Facebook ads: Russians targeted Texas secessionist movement, ripped Hillary Clinton More: Here's how Russian manipulators were able to target Facebook users After Facebook handed over the ads to Congress, lawmakers made dozens of them available to the public. House Intelligence Committee leaders pledged at the time to provide all of the ads to the public to increase awareness of the Russian manipulation. With the spotlight on upcoming midterms in the U. S. and other key elections around the globe, Facebook says it's moved aggressively to prevent foreign interference and anticipate new tactics to undermine the integrity of the electoral process. Political ads will be labeled and Facebook users will be provided more information about them, such as who paid for them. Facebook users will be able to see who placed an ad and some information about those users who saw the ad, as well as view other ads run by the same page. That includes the hot-button social issue ads. Facebook also reduced the ad targeting capability, removing nearly one-third of the terms used by the IRA, some because they weren't often used, others because Facebook says they didn't reflect Facebook's ""principles. "" It's a major turnabout for Facebook, which for years resisted complying with federal ad disclosure rules that apply to other types of media. Pressured by lawmakers, Zuckerberg promised last year to take steps to deter foreign governments from using Facebook to manipulate elections and to increase disclosure in political ads. Zuckerberg now says he supports a bipartisan Senate bill, the Honest Ads Act, which would bring political advertising on social media more in line with what is required on television and radio. Since the 2012 presidential election, political campaigns are increasingly using Facebook to target particular voters in a more precise, cost-effective way. Yet the social network is not currently required to follow any of the campaign finance laws that apply to other media. ""Going forward, we're going to address this by verifying the identity of every single advertiser who's running political or issue-oriented ads to make it so that foreign actors or people trying to spoof their identity or say that they're someone that they're not cannot run political ads or run large pages,"" Zuckerberg said during last month's testimony on Capitol Hill. Ridding Facebook of election meddling is part of a widening campaign to rebuild consumer trust after the personal information of 87 million users was harvested by Cambridge Analytica without their permission. Cambridge Analytica capped a tumultuous period for Facebook, which has been dragged down by one damaging revelation after another, from the proliferation of fabricated news and hoaxes to violence on its Live streaming service. In February, special counsel Robert Mueller filed criminal charges against 13 Russian nationals and three businesses for a wide-ranging effort to undermine the presidential election, including actions aimed at boosting Trump's campaign. Federal law bars foreign interests from making campaign contributions or otherwise working to influence U. S. elections. The charges included conspiracy, identity theft, failing to register as foreign agents, and violating laws that limit the use of foreign money in U. S. elections. One of the companies that was charged was the Internet Research Agency, which prosecutors accuse of waging ""information warfare"" against the United States with the goal of ""spreading distrust toward the candidates and the political system. "" Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, and possible obstruction of justice by the president. In addition to Mueller's probe, three congressional committees have been conducting their own Russia investigations. Both the House and Senate intelligence committees have investigated Russia's manipulation of social media, which the Kremlin continued even after the 2016 election. The Senate Intelligence Committee is continuing its investigation, and the Senate Judiciary Committee has been conducting a more limited probe. Republicans on the House Intelligence committee recently concluded their investigation, finding no signs that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians. The panel's Democrats are continuing to investigate on their own. Last fall, representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google appeared before two intelligence committees to talk about Russia's manipulation of their platforms. A sampling of Facebook ads paid for by the Internet Research Agency were released at those hearings, but the bulk of the ads had to be scrubbed of personally identifiable information before they could be publicly released.

Meta_1Month,WhatsApp founder plans to leave after broad clashes with parent Facebook,1 May 2018,Daily Herald,"1,176 words",0.0876,0.059,0.056,0.885,"English Copyright 2018 Daily Herald SAN FRANCISCO -- The billionaire chief executive of WhatsApp, Jan Koum, is planning to leave the company after clashing with its parent, Facebook, over the popular messaging service's strategy and Facebook's attempts to use its personal data and weaken its encryption, according to people familiar with internal discussions. Koum, who sold WhatsApp to Facebook for more than $19 billion in 2014, also plans to step down from Facebook's board of directors, according to these people. The date of his departure isn't known. He has been informing senior executives at Facebook and WhatsApp of his decision, and in recent months has been showing up less frequently to WhatsApp's offices on Facebook's campus in Silicon Valley, according to the people. The independence and protection of its users' data is a core tenet of WhatsApp that Koum and his co-founder, Brian Acton, promised to preserve when they sold their tiny startup to Facebook. It doubled down on its pledge by adding encryption in 2016. The data clash took on additional significance in the wake of revelations in March that Facebook had allowed third parties to mishandle its users' personal information. Facebook, though, needs to prove that its investment in WhatsApp - its largest acquisition ever - was worth it. Facebook declined immediate requests for comment. Koum's exit would be highly unusual at Facebook. The inner circle of management - and the Board of Directors - have been fiercely loyal during the scandals that have rocked the social media giant. In addition, Koum is the sole founder of a company acquired by Facebook to serve on its board. Only two other Facebook executives - CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg - are members of the board. Acton left the company in November. He has joined a chorus of former executives critical of Facebook. Acton recently endorsed a #DeleteFacebook social media campaign that has gained force in the wake of the data privacy controversy sparked by Cambridge Analytica, the political marketing firm tied to the Trump campaign, had inappropriately obtained the private information of 87 million Facebook users. Though the Cambridge Analytica revelations contributed to a climate of broader frustration with Facebook among WhatsApp employees, Koum made his decision to leave prior to the scandal, the people said. WhatsApp, with 1.5 billion monthly users, is the largest messaging service in the world. It is most popular in countries such as India, Egypt, and Brazil, and in Europe, where it is used for phone calls and text messaging with friends and businesses, as well as news distribution and group chats. Koum and Acton, former coworkers at Yahoo, founded WhatsApp in 2009. It promised private communications for 99 cents a year. By 2014, the tiny company had almost 500 million users. It caught the attention of Zuckerberg, who was looking to expand the social network overseas. After a dinner at Zuckerberg's house, Zuckerberg made an offer for WhatsApp that turned Acton and Koum into instant billionaires. But even in the early days, there were signs of a mismatch. WhatsApp had less than $20 million in revenues at the time of the acquisition. Facebook was making billions of dollars by selling advertisers access to its users, on whom it had collected large amounts of information. Koum and Acton were openly disparaging of the targeted advertising model. In a WhatsApp blog post in 2012, they wrote that ""no one wakes up excited to see more advertising; no one goes to sleep thinking about the ads they'll see tomorrow."" They described online advertising as ""a disruption to aesthetics, an insult to your intelligence, and the interruption of your train of thought."" The WhatsApp co-founders were also big believers in privacy. They took pains to collect as little data as possible from their users, requiring only phone numbers and putting them at odds with data-hungry Facebook. At the time of the acquisition, Koum and Acton said Facebook had assured them that WhatsApp could remain an independent service and would not share its data with Facebook. How and if WhatsApp would make money was left an open question. ""WhatsApp will remain autonomous and operate independently,"" the founders in wrote in a blog post announcing the acquisition. ""And you can still count on absolutely no ads interrupting your communication."" Eighteen months later, the promise not to share data evaporated. Facebook pushed WhatsApp to change its terms of service to give the social network access to the phone numbers of WhatsApp users, along with analytics such as what devices and operating systems people were using. WhatsApp executives were comfortable sharing some data with Facebook in order to measure who was using the service, according to the people. But they opposed using WhatsApp's data to create a user profile that was unified across Facebook's multiple platforms, which also include Instagram and Facebook Messenger, and that could be used for ad-targeting or for Facebook's data-mining. Acton and Koum acquiesced enabling Facebook to recommend that users' WhatsApp contacts become their Facebook friends, allowing Facebook to collect more data about those relationships. The changes also allowed advertisers to feed lists of phone numbers into Facebook's advertising system, known as custom audiences, and find new people to target with ads. Last year, the European Commission, the European Union's regulatory authority, fined Facebook $122 million for making ""misleading"" statements when the EU approved the WhatsApp takeover. Conflicts soon arose over how WhatsApp would make money. Facebook scrapped the 99 cent annual charge, and Koum and Acton continued to oppose the advertising model. The service still has no ads, but WhatsApp has embarked on experiments to make money: In January, Facebook rolled out a tool, called WhatsApp Business, to allow businesses to create a profile and send messages to their customers on WhatsApp. The founders also clashed with Facebook over building a mobile payments system on WhatsApp in India. Another point of disagreement was over WhatsApp's encryption. In 2016, WhatsApp added end-to-end encryption, a security feature that scrambles people's messages so that outsiders, including WhatsApp's owners, can't read them. Facebook executives wanted to make it easier for businesses to use its tools, and WhatsApp executives believed that doing so would require some weakening of its encryption. Ultimately, Koum was worn down by the differences in approach, the people said. Other WhatsApp employees are demoralized and plan to to leave in November, four years and a month after the Facebook acquisition, when they are allowed to exercise all their stock options under the terms of the acquisition of Facebook, according to the people. Acton donated $50 million of his money to Signal, a rival messaging app that is geared toward security and privacy. In a recent blog post announcing his donation and role as the executive chairman of the non-profit Signal Foundation, Acton said his goal was to build ""the most trusted communications experience on the planet."" whatsapp"

Meta_1Month,Technology,15 May 2018,NYTimes.com Feed,"1,267 words",-0.9964,0.062,0.126,0.813,"English .  SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook has been under pressure for its failure to remove violence, nudity, hate speech and other inflammatory content from its site. Government officials, activists and academics have long pushed the social network to disclose more about how it deals with such posts. Now, Facebook is pulling back the curtain on those efforts — but only so far. On Tuesday, the Silicon Valley company published numbers for the first time detailing how much and what type of content it takes down from the social network. In an 86-page report, Facebook revealed that it deleted 865.8 million posts in the first quarter of 2018, the vast majority of which were spam, with a minority of posts related to nudity, graphic violence, hate speech and terrorism. Facebook also said it removed 583 million fake accounts in the same period. Of the accounts that remained, the company said 3 percent to 4 percent were fake. Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice president of product management, said the company had substantially increased its efforts over the past 18 months to flag and remove inappropriate content. The inaugural report was intended to “help our teams understand what is happening” on the site, he said. Facebook hopes to continue publishing reports about its content removal every six months or so. Yet the figures the company published were limited. Facebook declined to provide examples of graphically violent posts or hate speech that it removed, for example. The social network said it had taken down more posts from its site in the first three months of 2018 than it had during the last quarter of 2017, but it gave no specific figures from previous years, making it hard to assess how much it had stepped up its efforts. The report also did not include all the posts that Facebook had removed. After publication of this article, a Facebook spokeswoman said other types of content had been taken down from the site in the first quarter because they violated community standards, but those were not detailed in the report because the company was still developing metrics to study them. Facebook also used the new report to advance a push around artificial intelligence to root out inappropriate posts. Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has long highlighted A.I. as the main solution to helping the company sift through the billions of pieces of content that users put on its site every day, even though critics have asked why the social network cannot hire more people to do the job. “If we do our job really well, we can be in a place where every piece of content is flagged by artificial intelligence before our users see it,” said Alex Schultz, Facebook’s vice president of data analytics. “Our goal is to drive this to 100 percent.” Facebook is aiming for more transparency after a turbulent period. The company has been under fire for a proliferation of false news, divisive messages and other inflammatory content on its site, which in some cases have led to real-life incidents. Graphic violence continues to be widely shared on Facebook, especially in countries like Myanmar and Sri Lanka, stoking tensions and helping to fuel attacks and violence. Facebook has separately been grappling with a data privacy scandal over the improper harvesting of millions of its users’ information by political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Mr. Zuckerberg has said that the company needs to do better and has pledged to curb the abuse of its platform by bad actors. On Monday, as part of an attempt to improve protection of its users’ information, Facebook said it had suspended roughly 200 third-party apps that collected data from its members while it undertook a thorough investigation. The new report about content removal was another step by Facebook to clean up its site. Jillian York, the director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said she welcomed Facebook’s numbers. “It’s a good move and it’s a long time coming,” she said. “But it’s also frustrating because we’ve known that this has needed to happen for a long time. We need more transparency about how Facebook identifies content, and what it removes going forward.” Samuel Woolley, research director of the Institute for the Future, a think tank in Palo Alto, Calif., said Facebook needed to bring in more independent voices to corroborate their numbers. “Why should anyone believe what Facebook says about this, when they have such a bad track record about letting the public know about misuse of their platform as it is happening?” he said. “We are relying on Facebook to self-report on itself, without any independent vetting. That is concerning to me.” Facebook previously declined to reveal its content removal efforts, citing a lack of internal metrics. Instead, it published a country-by-country breakdown of how many requests it received from governments to obtain Facebook data or restrict content from Facebook users in that country. Those figures did not specify what type of data the governments asked for or what posts were restricted. Facebook also published a country-by-country report on Tuesday. According to the new content removal report, about 97 percent of the 865.8 million pieces of content that Facebook took down from its site in the first quarter was spam. About 2.4 percent of that deleted content had nudity, Facebook said, with even smaller percentages of posts removed for graphic violence, hate speech and terrorism. In the report, Facebook said its A.I. found 99.5 percent of terrorist content on the site, leading to the removal of roughly 1.9 million pieces of content in the first quarter. The A.I. also detected 95.8 percent of posts that were problematic because of nudity, with 21 million such posts taken down. But Facebook still relied on human moderators to identify hate speech because automated programs have a hard time understanding context and culture. Of the 2.5 million pieces of hate speech Facebook removed in the first quarter, 38 percent was detected by A.I., according to the new report. Facebook said it also removed 3.4 million posts that had graphic violence, 85.6 percent of which were detected by A.I. The company did not break down the numbers of graphically violent posts by geography, even though Mr. Schultz said that at times of war, people in certain countries would be more likely to see graphic violence than others. He said that in the future, Facebook hoped to publish country-specific numbers. The report also did not include any figures on the amount of false news on Facebook as the company did not have an explicit policy on removing misleading news stories, Mr. Schultz said. Instead, Facebook has tried to deter the spread of misinformation by removing spam sites that profit from advertisements that run alongside false news, and by removing fake accounts that spread them.

Meta_1Month,‘We’re really going to feel the vibes’: Facebook’s F8 attracts marketers wanting answers,1 May 2018,Digiday,"1,114 words",0.9972,0.129,0.041,0.83,"Copyright 2018. Digiday.  Facebook's F8 developer conference in years past has resembled a pep rally, with Facebook wowing the assembled with new products, star guests like Andy Samberg and high-profile musical acts. This year's gathering should have a less triumphal tone (except for a performance by Logic), as the tech company grapples with pushback from the rise of fake news, its pivot away from media in its news feed and its data privacy scandals. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg instead needs to “demonstrate just how he plans to win back trust, not just from users, but also from investors and app developers,” said Michelle Steinberg, CEO of Domain Integrated, a digital marketing agency. “I expect a lot of hard questions will be asked. After all, this is a room full of software developers that understand Facebook’s technology and data.” The subdued tone doesn’t mean F8 won’t be newsworthy. Here’s what marketers should expect from the two-day event. Privacy, privacy, privacy Facebookreleased a new ad last week focused on security. “We’re committed to doing more to keep you safe and protect your privacy. So that we can all get back to what made Facebook good in the first place: friends,” the ad reads. Parker Ray, head of digital at MWWPR, said he expects Zuckerberg’s acknowledgment of the Cambridge Analytica scandal to come early to emphasize the importance, but also to “get it over with.” However, Facebook’s Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos will host a session titled “Security at Facebook Scale” following the keynote. F8 also arrives before General Data Protection Regulation takes effect on May 25. Facebook has one session about data use notices, which may be useful for those behind on what the GDPR means for Facebook. Zuckerberg may announce solutions for developers to access more data, given all the recently introduced restrictions. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook shut down access to some tools and cut off third-party data providers like Experian and Acxiom. “I expect Facebook to roll out a ‘native’ replacement for the third-party purchase data targeting. Facebook may license data directly from retailers and loyalty programs or predictively model purchase segments based on their extensive first-party data,” said Michael Horn, managing director of data science at Huge. WTF publishers Facebook hosted an off-the-record sideshow and also organized an official track for publishers at last year’s F8. But that isn’t the case this year. One publisher groused, “I am going to network primarily because I don’t expect much out of Facebook, other than more contrite apologies.” In January, Facebook announced its push for “meaningful interactions,” which meant favoring posts from friends and family over Pages. That change collapsed organic reach for big Facebook-focused publishers like Mic. But a major video publisher on Facebook said it hadn’t faced such drastic changes and that it’s still seeing success by natively publishing video on Pages and for Facebook Watch. “You have to be careful about not chasing your tail with new features, but you have to be aware of them,” the publisher said. “We’re really going to feel the vibes. Of course, the official panels and the tracks mean something, but as you’re there, you feel what the talk of the town is.” Facebook did reach out to some publishers for videos to showcase. Watch is still growing. Yet the platform needs to ensure that media companies can make money from it via better analytics and monetization like pre-roll, mid-roll and sponsorships. Family of apps The big blue app may be the largest social network. Yet Facebook has an embarrassment of riches, also owning three other billion-user networks that could incorporate more features for marketers. Instagram has faced some application programming interface restrictions, but marketers said they expect more improvements for analytics and storytelling, like with augmented reality. “You will see Facebook leveraging its AR Studio and Camera Effects even further and going after Snapchat quite aggressively, as Snap continues to push mobile AR. In the next year, we will see Facebook/Instagram and Snap battle it out for AR dominance,” said Cathy Hackl, futurist at You Are Here. Back at F8 2016, Facebookopened up Messenger as a platform for media and marketers to create chat-based experiences. Some partners like CNN and 1-800-Flowers jumped in early, but others waited. Shortly after Facebook’s decision to decrease publishers’ presence in the news feed, Quartz announced its new Messenger bot. Artists like G-Eazy have created bots to help sell merchandise. WhatsApp Business app, released in January, now has more than 3 million users, Facebook revealed last week. Both Messenger and WhatsApp could push more commerce experiences. Expanding AR and virtual reality Zuckerberg heralded augmented reality last year with the slogan, “We’re making the camera the first augmented reality platform.” (Coincidentally, this followed Snapchat declaring itself a camera company.) Facebook welcomed brands to use new AR tools. This year, representatives from Nike and Warner Bros. will speak on a panel about AR. Facebook also is expected to release its low-cost VR headset called Oculus Go. The product will cost $199, and it doesn’t require a phone or need to be tethered. That price point and ease of use could encourage more people to use VR and therefore convince more marketers to invest. “Facebook will be the platform in which many users first encounter and adopt AR and VR solutions,” Horn said. “The race is on to publish the first few killer apps using the new capabilities.” Snapchat announced shoppable AR earlier this month. Given Facebook’s history of copying Snapchat, it wouldn’t be surprising if F8 featured more AR commerce. Other bets for Facebook Facebook’s rumored video chat device reportedly won’t be onstage this year, but we can expect other businesses to get some attention. Facebook has two sessions for Workplace, its enterprise software that provides Facebook-like work chat. Of course, data privacy is something that’s scrutinized at the company, so businesses may be less willing to give the social network access to more of their information. Zuckerberg may emphasize the security of its current community in his keynote, but his long game has brought more people online. In last week’s earnings call, Zuckerberg revealed Facebook has provided internet access to more than 100 million people via Internet.org.

Meta_1Month,Activist Max Schrems accuses Facebook and Google of GDPR breach,25 May 2018,Financial Times (FT.Com),774 words,0.8627,0.075,0.062,0.864,"English Copyright 2018 The Financial Times Ltd.  Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. Facebook and Google became the first large tech groups to be accused of breaking the EU ’s far-reaching new privacy rules that came into force on Friday when an Austrian activist who has already beaten Facebook in a major privacy case filed complaints against them across Europe. Max Schrems and his non-profit organisation None Of Your Business filed four complaints under the General Data Protection Regulation — one against Facebook , one each against its subsidiaries Instagram and WhatsApp, and another against Google ’s Android. Tech groups have been preparing for an onslaught of similar claims under GDPR, new rules that govern how organisations process data on European citizens. Privacy International , a campaign group, is also planning action. Ailidh Callander, its legal officer, said it will write to four data brokers and advertising technology companies asking why they gather certain information and share it with third parties. Other companies were left scrambling to comply with the data rules even though they had two years to prepare, with uncertainty over the regulations having already triggered a landslide of emails seeking consent for the use of data held on customers. US news websites owned by the Chicago-based media company Tronc — including the Los Angeles Times , Chicago Tribune and Baltimore Sun — were not available to European readers after the rules came into effect. Some US apps have also withdrawn from the EU . Under the new regime, companies can face fines of up to 4 per cent of global revenue for ignoring GDPR rules on data gathering. Last year, that would have amounted to $1.6bn for Facebook and $4.4bn for Alphabet, Google ’s parent company. Mr Schrems said the fines were “mind-blowing” but he was “astonished” at what he said was companies not even trying to comply with the law. “They totally know that it’s going to be a violation, they don’t even try to hide it,” he told the FT. Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, said the social media giant spent the last 18 months making its privacy policies “clearer, our privacy settings easier to find and introduced better tools for people to access, download and delete their information”. Google said: “We build privacy and security into our products from the very earliest stages and are committed to complying with [GDPR]. Over the last 18 months, we have taken steps to update our products, policies and processes to provide users with meaningful data transparency and control across all the services that we provide in the EU .” All four of Mr Schrems’ complaints challenge the Silicon Valley companies on how they are obtaining consent from users. GDPR requires “informed and specific consent”. But Mr Schrems says Google and Facebook require a form of “forced consent” because users have to tick boxes agreeing to privacy policies or completely lose access to services they use. Companies can rely on different legal methods to collect personal data. They can argue the data are necessary to provide a contract, such as when an ecommerce provider needs to know an address to deliver a package, or they have a “legitimate interest”, which balances the companies’ need to process the data with the individual’s interests, rights and freedoms. Mr Schrems is known best for bringing down “Safe Harbour”, the mechanism used by thousands of companies to transfer data to the US. In a case that began as a complaint against Facebook , the European Court of Justice ruled that mass government surveillance in the US meant the companies using Safe Harbour could not guarantee Europeans’ fundamental right to privacy in America. He is also pursuing a second round of that case against Facebook , which is headed to the ECJ, and another privacy case against Facebook in Austria . None Of Your Business is helping four users file complaints to different data protection agencies — in Austria, Hamburg, Belgium and France — because, under GDPR, complaints no longer have to be filed in the European country where a company has its headquarters. Previously, complaints often went to the Irish data protection agency because many tech companies are based in Ireland, often because of its low tax rate. The case against Google was filed in France, where the company was fined €100,000 in 2016 for not complying with the European right to be forgotten. The case against WhatsApp was filed in Hamburg, where the data protection commissioner has already issued an order banning Facebook from sharing data with the messaging app. Additional reporting by Aliya Ram and Camila Hodgson in London"
Meta_1Month,"Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing; ""Cambridge Analytica and the Future of Data Privacy.""; Testimony by Mark Jamison, Visiting Scholar, American Enterprise Institute Director And Gunter Professor, Public Utility Research Center, University of Florida, Gainesville , FL",16 May 2018,Congressional Documents and Publications,"3,517 words",0.9954,0.093,0.02,0.888,"(c) 2018 Federal Information & News Dispatch, Inc. Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you at today's hearing on Cambridge Analytica and the Future of Data Privacy. I have had the opportunity to study communications, media, and internet policy issues over the course of many years and in several capacities, including in my current positions as the director and Gunter Professor of the Public Utility Research Center at the University of Florida and as a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. While I am proud to be affiliated with these organizations, I am appearing today solely on my own behalf, and the views and opinions I express should not be attributed to any of the organizations with which I am or have been affiliated. I can summarize my testimony in three sentences. First, the activity that led to this hearing and current controversy--using Facebook and other social media data in ways that are not transparent to users--is not unusual in modern political activity. Second, Facebook's problems appear to result from a rapidly changing company allowing its business model to drift from forming communities to serving advertisers and developers, not from a lack of regulation. Third, new regulations aimed at Facebook's errors are more likely to protect the business from competition than benefit consumers. Let me address each in turn. Political Campaigns and Facebook The Cambridge Analytica revelations triggered alarm as if using Facebook data was something new in presidential campaigns. It is not. That is not to say that it was appropriate for Cambridge Analytica to use data that it apparently was not supposed to have. Rather it is important to put the data use in context. The masters at integrating politics and social media were President Barak Obama's national campaigns, but they were not the first to do so. George W. Bush's presidential campaigns are noted for outclassing opposing campaigns in terms of microtargeting voters and using statistical modeling, n1 but the Democrats caught up by 2006, and President Obama's 2008 campaign was unprecedented in the sophistication in using social media and data analytics. n2 His 2012 reelection campaign was at an even higher level. For this reason, and because more has been written about President Obama's campaigns than on others, I will focus on his campaigns. From the start, President Obama's campaigns for national office were uniquely capable at obtaining and leveraging Facebook data and tools. Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes helped put together the new media strategy for Obama's US Senate and then 2008 presidential campaigns. n3 But as Tim Murphy of Mother Jones wrote, there was a problem: ""Facebook's terms of use limited the extent to which outside groups can mine the site. But the Obama campaign has found ways around those barriers too (sic)."" n4 More specifically, supporters were encouraged to log into My.BarackObama.com--a website where supporters could join local groups, create events, get updates, and engage in fundraising n5--using their Facebook accounts. This gave the campaign access to their Facebook data, which the campaign then used for microtargeting. n6 The 2012 campaign's use of social media and other data eclipsed by a wide margin all other political campaigns before 2012. Its strategic approach was based in part on advice from Eric Schmidt, then chairman of Google, and executives from Apple, Facebook, Zynga, Microsoft, DreamWorks, and Salesforce. The campaign hired experts in the use of big data for retail, social media, and data mining, who combined the 2008 data and data-gathering approach with data from numerous other sources, including information on people's media viewing habits, use of frequent-buyer cards from supermarkets and pharmacies, hunting and fishing licenses, magazine subscriptions, interests expressed on other social media sites, and membership rolls from labor unions, professional associations, and web browsing histories. All this was used for fundraising, developing volunteer networks, and messaging. Facebook's rapid growth led to it becoming a major source of information and an important communication channel for the Obama campaigns. Using the 2012 campaign's 25 million Facebook likes, the campaign matched Facebook profiles with other data to develop granular voter profiles. n7 The campaign's tech team was reputed to be able to exploit Facebook capabilities before even Facebook knew they existed. The team customized a Facebook app so that ""if an Obama supporter had, say, one thousand Facebook friends, the campaign could determine that nine hundred of them were already for Obama, focus on one hundred who were persuadable, and ideally zero in on six or so who lived in battleground states and were in regular enough contact to be considered real friends, not just Facebook friends."" n8 An opt-in Facebook outreach program sent supporters messages regarding, for example, whether their friends had voted and then encouraged the supporters to contact those friends who had not voted. n9 This required intimate knowledge of Obama supporters' Facebook friends and the nature of their relationships. Another innovation was a program called Dreamcatcher, a tool that analyzed what people wrote on campaign websites to assess sentiments and shape wording for messages. n10 The campaign gathered people's writings by asking them to make notes or tell stories. For example, the Pennsylvania campaign website asked people to tell why they wanted to be involved in the campaign and what President Obama had done that benefited them. The campaign's tech teams then analyzed the text-- looking for emotions expressed, sentiments, priorities, etc.--for purposes of targeted voter engagement and customized messages. n11 President Obama's campaign also surpassed Mitt Romney's in terms of analyzing TV viewing habits in detail, enabling the Obama campaign to narrowly focus TV ads. According to articles in the Atlantic and ProPublica, the campaign matched lists of voters to the names and addresses of cable subscribers. n12 The campaign team built a tool called ""the optimizer"" that correlated set-top box data with the campaign's own data. This gave the campaign information on which households had, for example, watched the first presidential debate. n13 Other campaigns have engaged in similar microtargeting and analytical efforts, including Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. But President Obama's campaigns were noteworthy for their unique access to Silicon Valley talent and their sophisticated use of Facebook and other social media information. Facebook's Business Failings I now turn my attention to the nature of Facebook's failings. The company's primary failure is not being clear and candid with its users. (I distinguish between Facebook's users, who are the subscribers, and the company's customers, who are the entities that buy ads and other services because of the company's user base.) For markets to perform well, users should have complete and understandable information on the nature of the services they are using, even those that have a zero monetary price as in the case of Facebook. This isn't happening. The company has changed how it serves and uses its subscribers without ensuring that they fully understand Facebook's evolving roles in their lives. Facebook's mission statement is: ""Founded in 2004, Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. People use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family, to discover what's going on in the world, and to share and express what matters to them."" This appears to have been true in 2004, n14 but things changed when growth and monetizing users became the company's primary metrics of success. In summary, Facebook morphed from a connector of communities to someone that investigates people's lives, filters their Facebook communications, and annexes nearby communities, such as Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook's rapid growth stalled in 2007, prompting the company to hire specialists whose primary purpose was to increase the number of regular users. n15 These experts, with backgrounds in internet marketing and building large customer bases, had direct access to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and provided a laser focus on growing the user base. The head of the first team, Chamath Palihapitiya, has expressed regret over what he appears to view as psychological manipulation that the company used to accelerate growth. n16 A former Facebook product manager has also lamented his role in ""turning Facebook data into money, by any legal means."" n17 These emphases led the company to begin developing ways for third parties to study users for retailing, scientific, and political purposes. It seems fair to describe the company's activity as gathering people into a context in which they reveal information about themselves so that others can use that information for marketing products and ideas. In a sense, Facebook's users are its product. Facebook's shift in focus from creating community to growing numbers and serving marketers appears to be a case of a company allowing itself to drift: Each step over the years probably made sense by itself, but taken as a whole they constitute a change in who the company is. At one time Facebook was a place where friends could share with little thought about who might be watching. Reality changed long ago, but only now are some users catching on. They must feel like they have been in ""The Truman Show""--a movie starring Jim Carrey in which the main character is living a seemingly ideal life in a friendly community until it is revealed that every aspect of his life has been captured by hidden cameras and broadcast to strangers. Many companies have gone down this road--taking their current customers for granted in some sense and focusing on monetizing them rather than respecting the relationships. For example, once it developed Windows, Microsoft knew it would be costly for people to switch to other PC-operating systems and applications because they would lose access to old files and struggle to share files with others. The company leveraged this for years by producing and charging customers for less than stellar versions of Windows. Customers felt compelled to ""upgrade"" because failure to do so could result in their being unable to share files with people who used the newer version. This gave Microsoft large profits for a while, but the profits became opportunities for Apple, Google, and others, who have given customers great alternatives to Windows. Windows' loss of prominence led Microsoft to recently announce that it will no longer have a Windows division. n18 One of Facebook's methods for expanding its reach was developing News Feed, which sends content to users based on Facebook's algorithms. News Feed has been profitable for Facebook, n19 but it has changed the company's relationships with its users. Now Facebook effectively chooses what people see, and it favors particular types of content. A recent and perhaps most famous episode is the suppression of content from Diamond and Silk. It seems fair to say that Facebook has become a discussion monitor, determining who is allowed a voice and who hears what voices on the platform. This is different from being a builder of community where everyone is connected and free to express him or herself. The qualities of Facebook's advertising algorithms made the site popular with persons who want to communicate political messages. Indeed, Facebook encouraged this by allowing politicians to make profile pages before it allowed others. One of its first customers was Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) in 2006. n20 But great targeting algorithms are valuable to good people and troublemakers alike, making Facebook a great place for Russians to disrupt political relationships in the US. The revelation that content on Facebook--some from fictitious persons--is not as trustworthy as people thought diminished the value of the network and created a political backlash. The company responded by engaging in further clampdowns, which only served to emphasize that the company is a filter rather than an open channel for communications. Regulatory Response I now turn my attention to my last point--namely that any new regulations intended to address Facebook's challenges are likely to harm Facebook users. There are two reasons. One is that the problems are business problems that commonly occur. What makes this instance notable is that it has happened in a company that has about half the world's internet users as its base. n21 The second reason is that new regulations would likely serve to protect Facebook and other large internet companies from competition. I have already described what I understand to be the nature of Facebook's problems. These show a company losing its focus and creating conflicting roles for itself with respect to its users. These problems are not unique to business: Government institutions, nonprofit organizations, universities, and religious institutions all commit similar errors. n22 Losing focus should not be illegal. Such mistakes are natural results of innovation and change, and an opportunity for competitors, so restricting them would be futile and would damage a dynamic tech economy. It is beyond my expertise to say if the company behaved fraudulently or broke agreements with users--and I have no information that would lead me to believe that either has happened--but if it has done either, existing laws can address the situations. Furthermore, any attempt to make such business mistakes illegal would likely make things worse since regulators would be making judgments on business models and strategy. Experience has shown that customers and businesses have better information on what customers value than do government regulators, making the free market the better disciplinarian than a less-informed regulator. Another consequence of new regulations would be less competition for large tech companies, such as Facebook. The European Union's new regulations on data collecting, storage, and use, called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), provide an excellent case in point. As my colleague at the American Enterprise Institute, Shane Tews, recently explained: [The GDPR requires] companies that collect or use personal data to ask for consent from their (European) users or customers. To comply with the GDPR, a company must protect information such as users' internet protocol (IP) addresses and cookie histories in addition to data such as names, addresses, government ID numbers, biometrics, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, political opinions, and tagged photos. All organizations that collect personal information (including third-party vendors) are considered data controllers and are accountable for any data collected, processed, or disseminated on an EU citizen. This includes companies that maintain databases containing personal data, even if they do not have a physical presence in the EU. They also have to be prepared for requests from EU citizens, who can ask for their information to be corrected, updated, or deleted by the organization holding the data. According to a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers survey, 77 percent of US companies expect to spend about $1 million or more to comply with the GDPR. Companies with the capability to separate and migrate data are moving quickly to transfer customers' data physically located in the EU onto servers in the US. n23 These regulations put governments in a troubling role of setting boundaries on what people can know and how they can use what they know when the information is legitimately obtained. While narrowly targeted restrictions on data retention and use might make sense in the well-defined context of physician-patient relationships, for example, broad application impedes freedom, stifles innovation, and raises costs. These effects on innovation and costs will lessen competition, resulting in harm to customers. Innovation is important to the competitive process. Economist Joseph Schumpeter called this creative destruction and explained that it is essential to well-functioning markets. Numerous economic studies have demonstrated that regulations create costs that favor large incumbents. As economists James Bailey and Diana Thomas recently wrote: [Regulation] represents a significant barrier to entry for new firms that seek to enter a market. Knowing the ins and outs of a specific regulatory framework that governs a particular industry represents a fixed cost of doing business that can be difficult for new entrants to an industry to overcome. . . . [It also] leads existing firms to engage in less risky and innovative behavior. [And] regulatory compliance costs represent a differential burden for small versus large firms. n24 Their study of the US economy found that increased regulation leads to fewer new businesses, less small business creation, and fewer large firms being replaced by new competitors. Earlier studies also support these conclusions. n25 Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, and members of the committee, this completes my written testimony.

Meta_1Month,Q1 2018 Match Group Inc Earnings Call - Final,9 May 2018,CQ FD Disclosure,"10,801 words",0.9995,0.192,0.01,0.797,"© 2018 by CQ-Roll Call, Inc.  Presentation OPERATOR: Good morning, and welcome to the Match Group First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this event is being recorded. And now I would like to turn the conference over to Lance Barton, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. LANCE BARTON, SVP OF IR & CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT, MATCH GROUP, INC.: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I'm joined on the call by our CEO, Mandy Ginsberg and CFO, Gary Swidler. They will review the Q1 investor presentation that is available on our IR website, and then we'll take questions. But before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that during this call, we may discuss our outlook and future performance. These forward-looking statements may be preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from the views expressed today. Some of these risks have been set forth in our earnings release and our periodic reports filed with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mandy. AMANDA W. GINSBERG, CEO & DIRECTOR, MATCH GROUP, INC.: Great. Thanks, Lance. Thanks, everyone, for joining our call to review the company's best results since the IPO back in 2015. We are delivering all-time bests across virtually all of our key operating metrics, and our momentum is fantastic. I'm sure some of you have joined the call to focus on recent external news, and I'm going to get to that in a few minutes. But first, I want to focus on the tremendous progress and results that we're reporting this quarter. So let's begin and turn to Slide 4. Tinder remains the primary catalyst for Match Group's growth as Tinder year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter exceeded 150%. This increase in revenue underscores that Tinder is clearly more than a subscriber growth story. We have multiple revenue drivers for this business, including subscription revenue, a la carte revenue, user growth and the various ways in which we optimize how we merchandise and price our features. Our focus is on driving revenue growth, so the mix of these components can and it will shift over time. Tinder is still in the early stages of how sophisticated we can be in terms of monetization and pricing given we only started offering paid features 3 years ago. So there is still room to optimize the various tradeoffs between subscriber growth and ARPU to maximize our overall revenue. In Q1, Tinder average subscribers grew 87% year-over-year and added 368,000 average subscribers sequentially. Renewal rates for Gold were higher than we thought, which led us to exceed our Q1 expectations. The continued strength in this metric makes it apparent that our users continue to see significant value in Gold. Year-over-year ARPU growth at Tinder in Q1 was the highest we have seen in 2 years, driven by 2 components. The first and most obvious driver is Gold, which was not in existence in Q1 last year. The second but less obvious component is growth in a la carte revenue from subscribers. On a sequential basis, a la carte revenue grew faster than subscription revenue as we have seen a lift in purchases of a la carte features. We are seeing that Tinder subscribers, both Gold and Plus, are willing to pay for additional features if those features improve the chances to connect with someone. The combination of dramatically higher ARPU driven by Gold and a la carte purchases and strong subscriber growth led to phenomenal revenue growth for Tinder in Q1. Turn to Slide 5, I want to take you through the Tinder product slide. I want to reiterate what I said on the last call, the biggest drivers of long-term revenue growth at Tinder are free features that make Tinder a simple, fun and useful product, creating a vibrant community of users that, in turn, drives word of mouth. Our monetization features are clearly important, and we're going to continue to develop and enhance these, but most users on Tinder experience the product for free. And while we are actively in development and about to start testing a new revenue feature that we'll launch in the second half of the year, the main focus for us is to give our customers more reasons to use Tinder and more reasons to use Tinder more frequently. We want to provide our users with features that make Tinder an integral part of their journey so that Tinder is a weekly part of their single social life. The first example is the Feed. We launched Feed to all Tinder users in Q1, and it is our first feature aimed at enhancing the post-match experience by delivering a visual experience that helps users start conversations with their matches. It gives users a better glimpse into the world of their matches, their passions, their personality, their latest adventure, all leading to better conversations and deeper connections. During testing, the Feed drove 25% increase in conversations with older matches and a 15% lift in overall conversations. The second area I want to talk about is video. We are currently testing our first video feature called Loops. Loops are user-generated 2-second looping videos, allowing users to show off more of their personality than just a picture. Profile pictures are one-dimensional and long-form videos can feel a bit awkward, but a loop can bring the user to life without that awkwardness. Loops will show up the same way pictures do within the profile. They will be in the card stack as users swipe through profiles, and Loops will also appear in the feed. And then you can see in the slideshow, the free PR we got when we launched, courtesy of Jimmy Fallon. He is definitely not on Tinder, but he had fun with Loops in his monologue. On the last call, we also mentioned that we're working on location-based features to enhance the Tinder experience in the real world. The places we go in our daily lives say so much about who we are and what we like to do. It's obviously where our life happens. The first step of our product journey in the real world is Tinder Places. Tinder Places is a new way for users to see potential matches who enjoy the same places they do. Whether it's their neighborhood bar, favorite coffee shop or a museum they love, they can connect to people who love going to the same places they love going to. This leads to higher-quality matches and more authentic conversations. We are currently testing this product in a closed beta with a small group of users in 3 international markets. In the first 3 weeks, we have seen these users go to 200,000 social places. Half of those users who opened the app engaged daily with Places, and 96% of users have continued to keep using the feature. This is a good indicator for both interest and sustainability of the feature. It's a completely user opt-in feature, and we have paid special attention to user privacy and control in designing this. We intend to make Places available to all users in these 3 cities this quarter. Again, it's still in beta, the early feedback is promising and we hope to roll it out globally soon. At that point, when we officially launch Tinder Places, we'll share more details about the product. We've also talked about providing women with more control on how and when matches communicate with them. This week, we started testing the Message First setting. We believe users want the option to choose who makes the first move, and we're giving them that choice. These examples are a glimpse into the product innovations that we are working on. I also am pleased to announce that we settled our IP litigation against TanTan, which will result in a redesign of their U.S. app and annual royalty payments tied to their U.S. user base. And this announcement reinforces the strength and value of our market-leading innovations. Turning to Slide 6, I want to talk through our marketing efforts. Tinder has become an iconic American brand. It's all about the fun and adventure of being single, and its viral growth is really unlike anything we've seen in the category. The brand has also resonated globally. Tinder is the top grossing lifestyle app in roughly 100 countries around the world and the second highest grossing app globally, non-games behind Netflix. This growth was driven primarily by word of mouth. In the past few quarters, we have started to supplement that viral growth with marketing spend in order to capitalize on the momentum and accelerate brand awareness to drive additional user growth. In the U.S., our marketing campaigns focus on college age users by leveraging relevant celebrities and brands. A few examples include Valentine's Day with Adam Levine and an expansion of our Tinder-U college ambassador program and a March Madness style contest where 64 colleges competed to win a free concert by music star Cardi B. In international markets where our awareness is growing rapidly but it's still lower than the U.S., we continue to increase awareness by working with globally recognized brands such as Man City soccer team. Through this partnership, we are creating exciting cannot buy experiences for Tinder users around the globe. In India, we launched a fun Bollywood-style Tinder video that captured the spirit of dating in India and resonated with young urban Indian women. This effort resulted in almost 2 million views and a wave of press. And in Brazil, we hosted the Camarote Salvador, the hottest party within Carnival, attended by many of Brazil's most important influencers. Through PR and social media, Tinder reached tens of millions of Brazilians. The growth of Tinder in unexpected markets like India and South Korea are initial evidence that this cultural phenomenon is global in nature, though still early in developing markets. And you can see from these examples that I mentioned, Tinder is not using traditional marketing channels like TV but rather celebrity endorsements, brand partnerships and Internet influencers. Even as we continue to expand our marketing efforts, we expect Tinder will remain a highly profitable and high-margin business, well above any of our other businesses or businesses in the category. Flip to Slide 7, as I want to talk about our other businesses outside of Tinder. Despite headwinds in TV marketing efficiency that I've talked about on our last call, our portfolio outside of Tinder remains stable, and we see opportunity to invest in product and marketing to drive long-term growth. Match and Meetic have both successfully transitioned their businesses from desktop to mobile-first products, leading to big improvements in conversion and engagement. They also remain 2 of the most recognized premium brands in the U.S. and Europe with a focus on serious intent. In order to continue distinguishing these brands from the competition, it's important we continue to evolve the product and deliver what is truly a premium experience versus alternatives in the market. To that end, we're going to make some moves to increase the value for users of these brands. For example, we're going to enrich the subscription by rolling in a la carte features that we previously charged for, decluttering the subscriber experience by reducing the number of ads, and last, we're increasing customer service levels. These changes are meant to drive word-of-mouth growth and ensure premium positioning of these brands that have historically relied on traditional marketing to grow. We also see opportunity to invest in increasing the awareness of some of our brands to drive their subscriber growth. OkCupid, for example, ended 2017 with some great product wins, materially increasing engagement, conversion and overall product appeal. We amplified those wins in Q1 by launching a provocative marketing campaign in OkCupid markets. We saw a 32% increase in aided brand awareness in New York City and a 13% increase in other test markets. More importantly, we saw double-digit registration growth in these markets indicating this is a viable marketing strategy that can help drive top of funnel at OkCupid. We plan to make further marketing investments into positive momentum, which should lead to increased awareness and adoption in the short and long term. In Japan, our Pairs brand has seen extremely strong subscriber growth and has benefited from the expertise of the Match Group following its acquisition in 2015. We are expanding our marketing spend in channels in Japan and are pushing the Pairs brand in Korea. The dating market is still relatively nascent in both Japan and South Korea as compared to the U.S. or Western Europe, which bodes well for long-term growth prospects of the business. Okay. Turning to Slide 8. Slide 8 addresses 2 forthcoming changes to our operating landscape. The first is GDPR and changes in data protection and privacy expectations. We are keenly aware that our customers share more intimate details than they typically share with their broader social network of friends and family. Therefore, we've always considered protecting our users' privacy a top priority in everything we do. And of course, we've been working to be fully compliant with GDPR regulations by the May 25th deadline. Tinder will be applying GDPR standards globally. Our businesses that are not subject to GDPR intend to nonetheless adopt similar privacy standards as required under GDPR. We really want to be a leader in protecting our users' sensitive data. The second is Facebook. We started getting inquiries about how changes at Facebook due to the Cambridge Analytica scandal might impact our business. And then, of course, major questions arose in light of Facebook's announcement last week that they planned on increasing their focus on dating. So let's start with Facebook's recent announcement because I know many of you are focused on this topic. First, let me say we respect the power of Facebook and its global scale. Their announcement about dating included very few specifics. Not many details are available for us to analyze, however, we definitely know a few things about the world of dating and this helps us assess what we think the impact could be. First and foremost, Facebook has been a part of the dating landscape really since inception. We know that people meet their significant other in many ways aside from online dating, including at bars, churches, through relatives and through friends and, not surprisingly, through Facebook. This is a result of introductions from friends and family, of course, but also through a series of subtle features on Facebook designed to introduce new people. In fact, Facebook has, over time, tried a number product features to enhance it as a source for dating. You may remember the Poke from the early days that faded. There's also Facebook Graph Search launched in 2013, which allowed users to search for things like ""single men who attended Harvard and lived in San Francisco"". And that was viewed at the time as a feature that would disrupt online dating. In 2017, Facebook launched Discover People to facilitate connection between people who aren't already Facebook friends, and a meet-up prompt in Messenger showed users people who want to meet up with them. We want to point out that none of these had any discernible impact on our business. We now know that Facebook is going to turn the screw further on the dating continuum, including the dating profile, which means users will declare explicitly that they are available to date and invite contact from strangers. I think this point is important. The expectation of overt dating features and apps reflect all the complicated emotions that dating involves: rejection, dissatisfaction, great dates, bad dates, and then ultimately, people churn. We in our category, have to deal with this. By explicitly introducing and promoting dating in their ecosystem, Facebook will have to confront and carefully manage this dating dynamic into their customers' experience. At F8, Facebook focused on connecting daters through flows in their events and group modules where they probably see some dating-related activity already happening. In my mind, it would make sense for them to limit dating focus to that aspect of their experience because it would minimize conflict with their core business. If that does end up being the case, then they're not going to compete with what our apps do, just as we don't think bars, churches, friends and family, nor Facebook today, directly competes with us and impacts our dating business. But it's really unclear at this point. Research also says that the vast majority of singles would not want to use Facebook for dating, primarily due to concerns with data and personal privacy, but more importantly, they don't want to be contacted by strangers on a social network meant for connections with friends and family. This resistant is particularly pronounced among women and the younger demographic. Another strong data point that gives us confidence that Facebook dating is unlikely to have a negative impact on Tinder, which is our biggest growth engine, is the striking result of our introduction of SMS sign-up on Tinder last year. Take a look at Slide 8 on the bottom right. Before last year, our users could only sign up using Facebook authentication. Within 2 months of offering Tinder users an alternative to sign up with Facebook, new users went from 100% Facebook sign-up down to only 25% Facebook sign-up, even though a Facebook sign-up was the first option on the screen and the most frictionless. Said another way, users quickly and decisively separated Facebook from their dating experience. The data we show from new user sign-ups is for North America, but the trend is very similar globally. And additionally, we saw a meaningful lift in new users joining Tinder after providing an alternative to Facebook sign-up. These were likely users who were previously unwilling to connect through Facebook who now saw an opportunity to finally join Tinder. When we asked our users why the aversion to logging in to Tinder via Facebook, the answer that came back was simple, a preference not to mix dating with their broad network of friends and family. We also know that in the context of dating, intent of community and the brand matters. This is not a utility feature. People want a community of users with similar intent. Dating is so personal, and we see people gravitate to brands they trust and they can relate to. A 23-year old who just graduated from college is going to use a very different brand than a 43-year-old single mom who wants a serious relationship. This is not a category when one size fits everyone, and it has never been a winner-take-all category. On average, people use 3 dating products at any given time. Tinder has earned and we believe will maintain its place as 1 of those 3, especially among younger users. It took the launch of Tinder 5 years ago to unlock a huge audience in their 20's. And why? Because Tinder is its own unique experience representing a sense of adventure and freedom that we don't believe Facebook can replicate, especially at the expense of their core experience. The global market for potential daters to connect through technology is very large. Over 600 million people, which doesn't include China. Of these, more than 80% do not currently use a dating product, largely due to category stigma. We have grown our business by chipping away at the stigma and bringing resisters into the fold. It is possible that Facebook can convince some of the resisters to try dating through technology, and therefore, they may be able to help break some of the stigma and further expand the category. Given our large product portfolio, we think we could benefit from this. Now turning to the other Facebook question. Is it likely that they change operating policies to our detriment? We don't think so. First, based on discussions with Facebook, we do not expect them to change any policies that relate to us. Second, our biggest dependency was the reliance on Facebook for Tinder log-in, but we have effectively removed that reliance by creating the alternative sign-up method I just mentioned. We don't have much reliance on Facebook for anything else. Our proprietary matching algorithms have never relied on Facebook. And now that most people sign up using SMS, most of the profile content is generated by the user. Even for those who sign up using Facebook, we only receive age, gender and photo, so we don't believe that any changes they will make will materially impact our Tinder business. We are going to continue to execute at Tinder and on our other products. We have a ton of experience in dating, and all we care about is delivering a better and better experience for our customers. If we do that with maniacal focus, customers will continue to come back and they'll thrive. I'm incredibly proud of the results this quarter, and I look forward to continued great performance. And I will turn it over to Gary, and he'll take you through the financial results and our outlook. GARY SWIDLER, CFO, MATCH GROUP, INC.: Thanks, Mandy. Match Group had an incredible first quarter of 2018 from a financial perspective as we built on the strength we experienced in the back half of last year. We are reporting our highest year-over-year quarterly revenue growth as a public company. And in Q1, we controlled expenses to achieve our best operating income and EBITDA growth in 2 years, resulting in a meaningful jump in margins. Our outlook for the rest of 2018 is extremely positive with increased expectations for full year revenue and EBITDA. Let's review the slides. On Slide 10, you can see that average subscribers reached over 7.4 million, up 26% year-over-year and up 2 points from Q4 2017's year-over-year growth. The strength was evident in both North America, which grew average subscribers 17% year-over-year, up 2 points from last quarter's year-over-year growth; and international, which grew average subscribers 37% year-over-year, also up from last quarter's growth rate. Tinder continued to be the story as it added 1.6 million average subscribers year-over-year, an 87% growth rate, and 368,000 sequentially. Tinder's subscriber growth was stronger than we'd expected as Gold renewal rates exceeded our expectations. We said on the call last quarter that our assumptions might be conservative, to the extent the 1-month Gold renewal rate and resub rates continued with the trends we were seeing. That, indeed, turned out to be the case, which helped drive Tinder subscriber growth in Q1 higher than our expectations. We discussed a number of times how Tinder Gold led to a surge in subscriber levels that began in Q3 2017. We expected this surge to moderate as we moved further away from the introduction of Tinder Gold. That proved the case in Q1 as the 368,000 subscribers we added was a smaller increase than we've seen in Q3 and Q4 last year but was higher than we'd expected because of the higher renewal rates. Strength in several of our other businesses also helped our subscriber trends. OkCupid domestically and Pairs in Japan showed particular strength in the quarter. And OurTime in Europe continues to grow. We also continue to see moderating subscriber declines at our Affinity brands, where trends are on track with our expectations. The decline in Affinity cuts overall subscribers, ex Tinder, to be down slightly. Overall, company ARPU is up $0.05, 8% year-over-year to an all-time high as a public company of $0.58. International ARPU benefited from FX rates. On a constant currency basis, international ARPU is up 7% to $0.52. Overall ARPU was up $0.02 or 3.5% on a constant currency basis. Tinder Gold has had a major impact on ARPU. Tinder's ARPU in the quarter grew 37% year-over-year. Tinder's ARPU continues to trend closer to the overall company ARPU. Tinder's ARPU has also been driven by accelerating ala carte sales, which have increased in tandem with the likes you feature within Gold. Flipping to Slide 11. You can see that the subscriber and ARPU growth led to year-over-year total revenue growth of 36%, up meaningfully from 28% last quarter. The last 3 quarters have all shown accelerating revenue growth. Excluding FX impact of $17 million, year-over-year revenue growth would have been 31%. We demonstrated strength in all components of the top line in Q1. Direct revenue grew 36%, driven by 26% subscriber growth and ARPU that was up 8%. Overall direct revenue as well as both the domestic and international components showed accelerating growth. Indirect revenue grew strongly at 33% year-over-year as we continued to see growth in programmatic revenue at Tinder and we increased direct ad sales. Total revenue, domestic direct revenue and international direct revenue growth rates were all the fastest we have achieved as a public company. EBITDA grew 60% due to the revenue growth and operating leverage. EBITDA margins were 34% in the quarter, up from 29% in Q1 '17. Overall expenses as a percentage of revenue were 72% in Q1 compared to 80% in the prior year quarter. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was up only $11 million year-over-year, resulting in a decline in its percentage of revenue from 36% in Q1 '17 to 29% in Q1 '18, reflecting the ongoing shift to lower marketing spend brands. The increases in marketing spend were at Tinder, OkCupid and Pairs, businesses with strong momentum and product wins, as well as at OurTime, as we continue to spend to roll out that brand across Europe. We reduced marketing spend at our Match, Meetic and Affinity brands. The Affinity reduction is a continuation of a trend that has been going on for several quarters now. The Match and Meetic reductions were driven by lower efficiency of marketing spend, particularly TV. We continue to be very judicious with our marketing spend in these businesses. Stock-based comp expense in the quarter declined by 6% to just under $17 million. The decline in SBC and lower depreciation as a percentage of revenue led to operating income growing faster than EBITDA. Operating income margins rose 8 points to 28% compared to 20% in Q1 2017. On Slide 12, you can see that the business continues to generate significant cash. Operating cash flow for the quarter grew 36% year-over-year to $122 million, and free cash flow increased 39% to $117 million. CapEx was only $5 million in the quarter. Free cash flow conversion from EBITDA in the quarter was 85%, above our target of approximately 75% for the full year. Our current trailing 12-month leverage is 2.4x on a gross basis and 1.9x on a net basis. Our cash balance of $288 million provides us solid financial flexibility for strategic M&A opportunities, buybacks, debt paydown or other uses. In Q1, we used $105 million of our cash to repurchase shares to offset dilution from employee option exercises and to pay withholding taxes on the option exercises. We have now repurchased a total of 1 million shares under our 6 million share repurchase authorization. By using cash to pay withholding taxes, we issued 1.9 million fewer dilutive securities. We did not pay any cash taxes in Q1 and do not expect to be a material U.S. cash taxpayer until 2020. On Slide 13, we discuss our outlook. The strength in Q1 led to a meaningful beat compared to the expectations we laid out last quarter. We expect this strength to carry over to Q2 with continued strong performance at Tinder coupled with operating leverage and stability across our other brands. Specifically for Q2, we expect revenue of $405 million to $415 million or 32% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Q2 revenue will continue to benefit from the impact of Gold subscribers that have been added over the past 3 quarters. Q2 '18 is the last quarter that does not have the Gold effect in the prior year quarter. We expect $160 million to $165 million of EBITDA in Q2 or approximately 48% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and margin of close to 40%. We believe that we have largely put the surge in Tinder subscribers from Gold into the rearview mirror, although surge lasted a quarter longer than we had initially expected due to the strength we have seen in renewal rates. We think Q2 will reflect a more typical level of sequential additions at Tinder, between 200,000 and 250,000. And that this level will once again, be the norm, at least until the new Tinder revenue feature is rolled out. As Mandy discussed in Slide 4 highlights, Tinder clearly is much more than a subscriber growth story. It has multiple revenue drivers, including sub growth, a la carte strength and overall ARPU improvement, with opportunities to optimize price and merchandise more effectively that we intend to pursue as the year progresses. As a result of continued strength at Tinder, particularly stronger first half revenues as Gold take and renewal rates are running higher than we initially expected, we are raising our full year outlook by $100 million to $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of total revenue. At the midpoint, that would be 24% year-over-year revenue growth. As a reminder, our back half of 2018 comps will be much tougher given the positive impact of Gold in the second half of last year. Our revenue outlook for our non-Tinder businesses is largely unchanged. We are primarily focused on optimizing profitability in these businesses. We will not chase subscriber growth at the expense of profitability. For full year 2018, we're raising EBITDA expectations by $50 million to $600 million to $650 million, 33% growth at the midpoint, more than double 2017's growth rate of 16%. The higher EBITDA expectations primarily reflect the additional revenue, particularly at Tinder, less additional IAP fees. Margin will be nearly 38% at the midpoint, representing an improvement of nearly 3 percentage points from the 2017 figure. We're expecting to over-deliver on our margin expansion expectation in 2018. We continue to believe that 40% plus is a reasonable long-term target for the company's margins. Tinder continues to experience meaningful operating leverage. Even with solid investment levels and product and marketing spend to drive new users globally, Tinder EBITDA margins in Q1 reached north of 40% for the second consecutive quarter. We expect this to be the case again for Q2 with room for additional expansion over time. We do expect higher Q3 marketing spend at Tinder as we focus intently on the back-to-school opportunity for university students. There are several key items that we're keeping an eye on, which will affect where in our current ranges we land for the full year. These include: first, the new Tinder revenue feature. The new feature is far along in development, and we plan to test it over the coming months and introduce it in the second half of the year. The precise timing and the success of this feature will have an impact on whether we are able to reach the upper half of our revenue range for the year, based on the new raised guidance. Second, data privacy and regulatory compliance requirements are shifting quickly. Certain shifts that result could require us to make product changes, delay our product road map or dedicate resources to make adjustments. Our outlook includes GDPR and all known data privacy and regulatory impacts. One last note. For everyone's modeling purposes, I wanted to mention that last time I said our GAAP effective tax rate would be in the low 20s percent range for 2018. It is difficult to predict the pace of employee option exercises and their impact on tax rates. But based on what we have seen so far, our 2018 GAAP effective tax rate could be meaningfully below the low 20s rate we previously indicated for 2018 and is likely to be volatile quarter-to-quarter. Stepping back, we really could not have hoped for a stronger quarter to start the year. The Q1 performance has led to additional optimism for the full year, and we're pleased to be able to raise our outlook so meaningfully. We believe our outlook now much more accurately reflects what you expect from us this year. We have confidence that Match Group will deliver its strongest year yet as a public company in 2018. We'll now answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the line to questions. Questions and Answers OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And this morning's first question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. DANIEL SALMON, MEDIA AND INTERNET ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Good morning everyone. Mandy, thanks for addressing the Facebook-related concerns head on, and in particular, on Slide 8 here, this chart around Tinder registrations not using the sign-up and how we've seen this pretty significant change there since you launched that. Of course, there are other ways that you interact with Facebook. You spend marketing dollars there. You've also got an advertising sales partnership with Facebook Audience Network. Are there any other material changes in your relationship that you might expect going forward as they come into the space a little bit more officially? AMANDA W. GINSBERG: Okay, great. All right. Okay. So you pointed out, Dan, that we definitely have a multifaceted relationship with Facebook. And they've been a long-term partner for us. We have been in conversation since the announcement at the executive levels, and they have certainly indicated to us that they don't plan to change either the auth or the advertising relationships. And they dealt with these complex and similar relationships in other verticals like e-commerce with Marketplace. The good news is -- which I mentioned, is that our reliance on sign-up has declined dramatically since last summer. On the advertising side, which you pointed out, a few of our brands spend on Facebook, particularly Match, Meetic and OurTime, which is our 50-plus brand here in the U.S. That said, it's one of the many digital channels that we use. And it's a relatively small percentage of our spend across all the businesses. It's in the single digits. And we believe that as long as spending on Facebook is ROI positive and it's sufficient spend for us and Facebook doesn't misuse our data, which we don't think they will, we'll continue to spend there. So Facebook Audience Network is the last question you had. We have a great relationship with them. It makes sense on both sides, but there's definitely alternatives in the market. To the extent we would need to go somewhere else, we would. But at this point, we don't think that it makes sense. And then I just want to sort of take a step back, and all of that said, they announced last week that they are an overt competitor in dating, so we're just going to have to monitor and adapt as needed. OPERATOR: And the next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen. JOHN RYAN BLACKLEDGE, HEAD OF INTERNET RESEARCH, MD AND SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions. The 75% of Tinder registration that don't use the Facebook sign-up, could you just remind what time period does that cover? And how long is the sign-up process if users don't use the Facebook sign-up? And then second question on Tinder, so the a la carte growth was really strong in 1Q. If you could provide some more color, that would be great. And what percentage of Tinder revenue was a la carte in 1Q '18? AMANDA W. GINSBERG: Okay. Let me talk to the first one. So the rollout started in June/ July time frame. And after about 2 months, 75% of new users were using alternative sign-up. And I mentioned it in my remarks, but the chart is U.S., but it's the same picture globally. And then just to address questions you had about process and how easy it is, it's a pretty easy process. So download to profile rates, we looked at are virtually identical between Facebook auth and SMS. And the quality of the profile through both of these flows are similar. So we don't see a degradation in quality. It really doesn't create much more friction for the user. And on the a la carte, Gary, do you want to take that? GARY SWIDLER: Yes, sure. In the a la carte, I think you should think about sort of 2 components to it. First of all, Gold has driven a la carte increases generally, so that's helped significantly, particularly Boost, which worked very well with the Gold subscription. So that's been a component of it. We've also seen a lot of strength in Super Likes lately. So it's multifaceted on both of our a la carte pieces. Super Likes and Boost are driving the strength there. In terms of the percentage, we talked previously about it being kind of 1/3 or so of the overall subscriber revenue at Tinder. As Gold has driven subscription revenue higher, that percentage actually has come down a little bit. So I'd say probably just a little bit south of 30% or around 30% is the way to think about it. But it's not because of weakness in a la carte. It's actually because of the strength on the subscriber side. OPERATOR: And the next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. ROSS ADAM SANDLER, MD OF AMERICAS EQUITY RESEARCH AND SENIOR INTERNET ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions. Back to the Facebook topic. If we take it up a level, how much of the kind of top of the funnel MAU growth, either organic or paid, comes from Facebook, not just for Tinder but across all brands? You mentioned single-digit percent of marketing, but what about just inbound kind of traffic? And then the second question is on GDPR. You mentioned in the guidance potentially some risk around GDPR. Can you just remind us what the revenue or sub base in Europe is today? And any additional color on what might happen post GDPR? AMANDA W. GINSBERG: Okay. So Ross, Facebook for us is really not an organic channel, it's a paid channel for us. If we look at all the registrations across all of our products, the percentage of registrations from Facebook is really small. It's like around 5%. So it's not a meaningful number for us. In terms of MAU growth across all businesses, the vast majority is organic. It's like well over half is organic. And if you look at the businesses that pay for acquisition, it's really Match, OurTime and Meetic in Europe. And there's a number of channels that are much bigger. So you've got TV and over-the-top and display and search, and Facebook is probably around the third or fourth channel. So we don't see a big risk there. And as I said, we'll continue to spend, especially if the spend is sufficient, on Facebook because it's been a good channel, though relatively small channel for us. GARY SWIDLER: And, Ross, on GDPR, just to be clear, all the impacts from GDPR and, in fact, all the known privacy and regulatory things that we need to deal with are included in our guidance. The GDPR has been a big effort across the company to make sure we comply by the May 25 deadline, and we're on track to do that. And we spend a lot of time and resources and money to make sure that we're doing what we need to do. It's not massive amounts, but it's there and it's all included in our numbers for the year. And there's also revenue effects because we're adjusting auto renewals for places where we control the payments and so forth. So all that is baked in, but there are revenue and cost impacts of GDPR and all the compliance things that are going on. Again, all that is baked into our numbers for this year. The thing that's not baked in is what we don't know. So to the extent other jurisdictions put in new privacy things that we need to comply with and we don't currently comply with, or other effects happen out of this much more intense focus on privacy, that would potentially move around our outlook but we think would be manageable within probably the ranges we have. But that's the thing that's not factored in. The known things, including GDPR, clearly factored in at this point. OPERATOR: And the next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. JASON STUART HELFSTEIN, MD AND SENIOR INTERNET ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER & CO. INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So two questions, one on Facebook and then a business question. So just can you help us understand, Facebook terms of service seem to suggest they can use all of the data they learn from you for their own benefit. So any views on that? How do you think about it? And then this has been a big question kind of why Facebook is doing this, and those of us who just looked at the sector for a long time have generally believed in that people do want to keep their dating and personal behavior separate. When I think about walled garden and you take Google and Travel, for years, they've thought about entering the space, but instead they'd rather just collect an advertising fee from the big players. So maybe if you can pontificate a bit more why you think Facebook is wanting to do this as opposed to try to maybe extract just a greater tax from you on the advertising side. And then just business-wise, on the reduction in planned marketing spend, Gary, is this just a function of like ROI requirements and you're not seeing it? And just how should we think about kind of if TV continues to be less effective, how you continue to drive growth with paid marketing? AMANDA W. GINSBERG: Okay. So a number of questions there. So let me take the first one, which is around Facebook competing against us with our data. So we definitely looked at the terms of service, and it does give them broad rights. But what you're bringing up truly is like it's a business ethics question, about how they use our data. And this is an issue that they've addressed with us head on in executive level conversations we've had, obviously, since last week's announcement. And they have indicated that they are not going to use information about our users that they receive through the authentication relationship or the advertising relationship. And any targeting that they would do would be based on information that's available for everyone. We've been a long partner for them, and honestly, I can't imagine Facebook would want to compromise the partnership, but more importantly, it's a trust issue. And the users' trust is part of these partnerships. And so my sense is right now, so it's too early to tell, but we have been assured that there is going to be integrity in our relationship. And then in terms of competition, about how we compete, at the end of the day, I really don't think, and I'll get to your next question, I don't think that people are going to be comfortable mixing their dating lives with Facebook. And so user targeting is not nearly as much of a big concern of mine at the moment. And then in terms of why Facebook is doing this, I can't speculate. I'm not sure. We sort of laid out in the remarks that the challenges they will have, especially in balancing the core user experience with dating, which is a great business, but it's also a business -- I mean, dating can be tough, online dating is a factor of that. Someone told me that dating someone is great when you are really into someone, but dating in general can be hard. And so we deal with all the dynamics around dating. And I think that by introducing a dating feature into their products, they will have to do that, too. So not sure, I think we'll learn more as more details are told to the market. GARY SWIDLER: And, Jason, in terms of your question on the ROIs on marketing. We're not moving our hurdles in any way. It's not a question of the hurdles being changed. The real reality is that TV has become more expensive. The cost of bringing in a user that way has gone up, as eyeballs have really moved from TV to digital, which isn't as engaging, isn't as effective. TV has always been a great source for us. So we're trying to maintain our discipline on our hurdles. And to the extent that means we can't spend as much, we're not spending as much. It's as simple as that. Obviously, we're focused on the impacts of that and hoping that additional channels open up that we could find effective and hit our hurdles and spend. And if we do, we definitely will do that. In the interim, we're making the improvements on the products that we talked about, trying to drive more word of mouth and replace some of what we lost on the TV side in other ways. So that's the strategy around, particularly, Match and Meetic, where the effect of what's happening with TV is the most pronounced. OPERATOR: And the next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. ERIC JAMES SHERIDAN, MD AND EQUITY RESEARCH INTERNET ANALYST, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe 2 with respect to the focus around Tinder and growth. One, I want to know how you're thinking about sort of allocating resources, whether it be R&D dollars behind product or marketing behind initiatives around subscriber growth or monetization awareness on a global scale. What are those areas of focus within the company to continue to drive the momentum? And second, coming out of that, what's sort of the message you think investors should have about growth versus margins for Tinder as we look not only in 2018 but beyond? GARY SWIDLER: Sure. Let me take a crack at it. First of all, we have really been investing on both the product and marketing side at Tinder. And we see real things we're trying to accomplish in both to continue to roll out product that is enhancing engagement and driving new users, as we talked about, as well as roll out some revenue features. And so we continue to add headcount there. We continue to add top class engineering talents, AI talent, and we've been spending on product and bringing engineering to drive products. So as far as that goes, clearly, we see that Tinder is our growth engine, and we're investing where we can to drive the product at Tinder. And similarly, on the marketing side, we didn't have to market initially, as Mandy talked about in her remarks, at Tinder. And Tinder grew virally around the world out of the box in a way that we've never seen before. But there are still lots of things to do at Tinder now at this stage of its development, which include continuing to raise awareness of the product in international markets. And we're spending money there where necessary to try to drive awareness in India, in Korea, elsewhere in Asia, where we see real opportunity. And we're going to continue to do that. As well as in the U.S., where Tinder needs to continue to evolve in terms of how people perceive the product. And we're spending money there as well and to work through further involvement with the younger demographic as people age and turn 18 and go to college to try to drive some of those users to Tinder. So all of those things are key priorities for us. And Tinder is an incredibly profitable business, as we talked about. And we're spending, I think, very appropriately in both product and marketing to achieve our strategic objectives. And in fact, if you go back to 2017, which seems like a long time ago, but I'd say it isn't that long ago, you'll remember that we talked about reducing margins at the company, at Tinder in particular, because we had to start spending on marketing and to try to drive user growth in part with some marketing. And we took a step back in margin and we said, overall, longer term, we think that will be useful from a growth perspective and we'll see margin enhancement at Tinder over time. And that's, in fact, what's happening. And you're starting to see the results of all that now as Tinder's margins are expanding while at the same time Tinder is achieving tremendous growth. And so we're really enjoying both margin and growth at Tinder, and that was the long-term plan that we put in place. OPERATOR: And the next question comes from Sam Kemp of Piper Jaffray. SAMUEL JAMES KEMP, VP AND SENIOR INTERNET RESEARCH ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY COMPANIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: So looking at the re-segmentation that you did with North America versus international subs for the OkCupid allocation, looks like subs were growing at least 12% by the end of 2017 in international. Can you just talk about, has that continued into 2018 now? And is OkCupid finding a bigger opportunity outside the U.S. than it has inside the U.S.? And then the other brand I wanted to talk about was, you called out Pairs several quarters in a row now. Can you just talk about how big is that business today? Perhaps can you just contextualize a little bit more where the Japanese and South Korean dating markets are in their evolution? GARY SWIDLER: Mandy, do you want to take the Pairs question? AMANDA W. GINSBERG: Sure. So let me talk about Pairs because we have talked about it. We mentioned it in the slide today. So if you look -- we do think there's opportunity in the Asian market generally, and I'll talk a little bit about Japan. But in the Asian market, there's population growth, it's a young population, there's smartphone penetration. And the fact is there's still a real cultural stigma in dating. And so I equate it to what it was like 15-20 years ago in the U.S. when online dating first came on to the forefront. On your question specifically on Pairs, it's one of the biggest economies in the world, and then it lags in U.S. and Europe in terms of dating penetration for the reasons I just mentioned. It is a high-growth business, and we don't break out the specific business by business, but you can roughly compare the revenue to the size of about OkCupid or PlentyOfFish. And for Pairs, in particular, it is a product that targets people looking for a serious relationship, and they've seen a real -- we've seen a real growth in that market despite the fact that there's government regulations and you actually can't advertise in a lot of channels, including television marketing. So as hopefully the market is destigmatized, we'll also see opportunity to spend more and, hopefully, open up some of those channels. But we just think that in Japan, there is a particular need for these products and people are willing to pay for them. The team is really strong in Japan, and we think that we can take these learnings and use those learnings for other markets, particularly for South Korea. So we'll see. But I think there's some real opportunity, both with the Pairs brand as well as Tinder. So let me talk a little bit about Tinder because -- you didn't ask me that, but I think that is also a great opportunity for us in Asia and in Japan. We've seen real growth in younger segments in Asia, and these are the 2 main brands with Pairs and Tinder that we're going to go after. And then the last thing which I just want to address because I think it's one of the reasons why we feel confident and bullish around that market is that there was a real question about whether or not people would pay in Asia. And we've seen, in particular, in Pairs, it is our highest LTV and our highest ARPU business, so people really are willing to pay for products. GARY SWIDLER: And, Sam, maybe just to give a little more color on your question. On the International side, ex Tinder, and Tinder is obviously driving a lot of international growth, but ex Tinder, Pairs and the new OurTime brand in Europe are probably driving the preponderance to that growth. OkCupid has a small business internationally, but I don't think it's a major contributor to the overall growth that you alluded to. We would consider however trying to push OkCupid internationally. We think now that the product is working pretty well and we're seeing real resonance in the U.S., continuing to expand internationally could be part of the plan for OkCupid. And in fact, PlentyOfFish also has seen some strength in some international markets, particularly in English speaking markets and we could push PlentyOfFish internationally as well. So those are some things that we are thinking about. The one thing that overall you highlighted and I just wanted to mention, though, is strength in OkCupid. And we talked about how we are investing behind OkCupid on the marketing side, and we're pleased with the product wins they've had there. You can see that over the past couple of quarters, OkCupid's growth has accelerated meaningfully and it is performing very strongly. So it is valid a point that overall, that OkCupid is performing well. OPERATOR: And the next question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. CHRISTOPHER DAVID MERWIN, RESEARCH ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I just had a couple. The first one is on Facebook. Can you talk about how the API changes affect how data from public Facebook profiles flow into the Tinder app? Will users that signed up through Facebook, have to manually reenter their information into their Tinder profile? And can they still see friends in common? And if not, do you think this changes the user experience in any meaningful way? And then just a second one on the trajectory of the core business, I think, Gary, you mentioned that subs have been down slightly year-on-year in the quarter. Was that the case for revenue as well? And is flattish growth the right way to think about the trajectory of the core for the rest of the year in the context of your updated guidance? AMANDA W. GINSBERG: Okay, Chris. Let me take the Facebook question. So in addition to credentials or authentication, really, the only information that we get from Facebook API is age, gender and photo. Then really, what happens in the ecosystem, because remember, people want to sort of put their best foot forward and impress people in the dating world, and so they will enrich their profile with additional photos that they give to us within our ecosystem. And so we get additional photos, bio, music from Spotify, which is on the profile, and then you can also input work and school. So we do not see a lot of friction. Users will do that for the reason I stated before, that they want to put their best foot forward. For users who previously signed up through Facebook, their profile on Tinder remains unchanged. GARY SWIDLER: I think in terms of the revenue question, revenue is basically flat in those businesses, in the non-Tinder businesses. And I think that's our expectation as the year progresses, that revenue is going to stay flat. I think we're thinking along the same lines on the sub side. The question around all that is something that we've talked about a little bit throughout the call, which is, what is the marketing opportunity? And do we find opportunities to spend? To the extent we don't find opportunities to spend, that will put some pressure on sub growth in the non-Tinder businesses, particularly at Match and Meetic. And so that's what we're watching. That's probably where the variability is, the sub growth being sort of connected to the marketing spend opportunity. So we'll have to see how that all plays out as the year goes on. But generally, the assumptions around revenue being flat, subs being flat, is still kind of our operating principle. OPERATOR: And the last question today comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. DOUGLAS TILL ANMUTH, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just thinking higher level here, in the slides, you talked about, about 600 million unattached singles globally. If we think about Tinder's having maybe around 35 million to 40 million maybe higher MAUs, could you just discuss how you think about Tinder's TAM and what the potential longer-term penetration of paid subscribers as a percentage of MAUs could look like? And is there any reason that paid member penetration would be structurally lower than other premium services, for example, like a Spotify, over time? GARY SWIDLER: Okay. Let me take a crack at that, and let me try to do it outside of confirming some of the numbers that you threw out that we haven't really thrown out. But as far as the 600 million TAM, obviously, we think that's the right number. We focus on Tinder's demographic, core demographic, being in the kind of 20- to 30-year-old range. So rough estimate off top of my head would be kind of 1/4 of that 600 million TAM is probably in Tinder's core demographic globally. So that's obviously still a very big market, around 150 million people globally, ex China. And we believe that Tinder is well positioned to keep capturing more and more of that market over time. That's why we're spending the marketing dollars. That's why we're focused internationally and putting forth those efforts because we see significant opportunity, particularly in those developing markets globally. In terms of kind of payer penetration levels, the only thing that we can tell you is we feel very confident that we can drive those numbers higher and higher over time. Obviously, it depends on the product road map and what we roll out and whether people find those features appealing. But if the past is any prelude on that, we continue to have a lot of success rolling out features that users find appealing and are willing to pay for. In fact, the adoption from a payer standpoint of our recent feature has been incredibly strong. We think we're still in that strong adoption point. So we'll expect to continue to make progress there. We'll continue to drive payer penetration higher. What the ceiling is, how it compares with others is really hard to say. It will depend on a lot of different things, including how we price the different features, what we offer for free. Our category is different than music in a variety of ways, for example, are different than other categories because it's something that's incredibly important to people and they see incredible value in it, which is why we've been able to continue to drive overall ARPU up at Tinder. And so those, I think, are some of the factors to think about as you think about kind of where penetration levels can go. So -- but the only thing I'd say is we definitely have confidence in it going higher. Hard to say kind of where that overall ceiling may be, and it will depend on kind of how we approach a variety of different things as we balance everything out. DOUGLAS TILL ANMUTH: Okay. And any comments just on overall MAU numbers, where you are now for Tinder? GARY SWIDLER: Not today. DOUGLAS TILL ANMUTH: Okay. Hopefully soon. Thanks. OPERATOR: And as it was this morning's last question, I would like to return the call to management for any closing comments. AMANDA W. GINSBERG: Sure. Well, thanks for joining the call. The one thing I would say is we spent a lot of time talking about the announcement last week, but we didn't spend nearly as much time talking about the thing that we love to do and that we deliver every day, which is really product innovation. And we feel like we did many years ago create the category and are constantly evolving it and disrupting it. And I think that -- I just want to end by saying that the reason we feel that the future is bright is because we've got teams sort of across the globe that are really focusing on how do we create phenomenal products that truly change relationship outcomes. And if we keep doing that, I think that we're going to be in great shape. OPERATOR: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Meta_1Month,Pro Bankruptcy,18 May 2018,WSJ Pro Cybersecurity,814 words,-0.8736,0.024,0.037,0.938,"English , Inc. Cambridge Analytica LLC, embroiled in controversy following allegations of misuse of Facebook Inc. data during the 2016 presidential campaign , filed for bankruptcy protection in New York. The data firm's U.K. branch, which was at the center of the controversy, filed for protection from creditors in the U.K. earlier this month. Thursday's chapter 7 filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York was made along with the U.S. arm of Cambridge Analytica's consulting business, SCL Group. The decision to close down operations comes after Cambridge Analytica said it saw a sharp drop in business following the Facebook revelations earlier this year. The data firm, which worked with President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016, has also been criticized for the tactics it pitched to clients. The allegations triggered a backlash. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was summoned to answer questions before Congress about the social media site's role in the Cambridge Analytica data-collection business. Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to meet next week with leaders of the European Parliament, as the EU prepares to introduce tough new rules on data privacy. In March, Cambridge Analytica suspended its chief executive , Alexander Nix, and said it was launching an independent investigation to determine if it engaged in any wrongdoing in its work on political campaigns. The firm, which has denied wrongdoing in the Facebook incident, earlier this month said it was shutting down , citing the ""siege of media coverage"" that drove away virtually all of its customers and suppliers. The announcement raised concern in some quarters that Cambridge Analytica was closing shop only to shake off the controversy and was transferring its business to London-based Emerdata. Ltd. Emerdata is Cambridge Analytica's majority owner, with an 89.5% stake. Money to pay Cambridge Analytica's U.S. bankruptcy lawyer came from Emerdata, court papers say. Cambridge Analytica was known for its financing of conservative candidates with backing from the Mercer family. Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer, daughters of hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, were on the company's board. In March, the two sisters joined the board of Emerdata on the same day Facebook said it would suspend Cambridge Analytica from buying ads after learning that the data firm had improperly harvested data. U.S. Bankruptcy Court documents signed by Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer said there would be no money to pay Cambridge Analytica creditors. Among Cambridge Analytica's creditors in the U.S. bankruptcy case is Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.). Mr. Thune is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. A spokesman for Mr. Thune said the committee has an outstanding request for information from Cambridge Analytica and is ""one of multiple government investigators listed in the bankruptcy filing as a creditor,"" along with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Election Commission. It isn't clear what the trans-Atlantic insolvencies will mean to the rights of tens of millions of Americans whose data were collected by Cambridge Analytica and sold for the use of political campaigns. U.S. bankruptcy papers estimate the assets of the two companies in bankruptcy are worth less than $500,000. Lawyers representing Cambridge Analytica and SCL in the U.S. and U.K. didn't respond to questions about ownership of the data. Assets of bankrupt companies are typically auctioned to the highest bidder. Earlier this month, British data privacy regulators took action to force the data-mining company to disclose to David Carroll, an American, the information it had collected on him. Ravi Naik, a British lawyer representing Mr. Carroll, said Friday the company's decision to close won't impede the enforcement of the U.K.'s data privacy laws. ""We expect full compliance,"" he said. Britain's Information Commissioner's Office, a privacy watchdog, has ordered an arm of SCL to disclose to Mr. Carroll, an associate professor at Parsons School of Design, what information was gathered on him, as well as how it was analyzed and disclosed to others. Mr. Naik says the ICO has the servers where the data resides, so the legal demise of Cambridge Analytica and SCL won't put the data out of reach. ""They can fold, but the data won't die,"" Mr. Naik said. In response to reports of Cambridge Analytica's plan to shut down, U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: ""Whether or not the people behind the company decide to fold their operation, a continued refusal to engage with the ICO will potentially breach an Enforcement Notice and that then becomes a criminal matter.""

LONDON—Cambridge Analytica LLC, the firm at the heart of Facebook Inc.'s data scandal , is liquidating assets and has asked workers to vacate its London office, according to employees. In an hour-long meeting on site, administrators told about 40 employees that the firm was liquidating to pay off creditors after failing to receive any credible buyers, according to one employee attending. Representatives for Cambridge Analytica and its administrator weren't immediately available to comment. Earlier in May, the company said it was ceasing operations after allegations of misuse of Facebook data led to a sharp drop in business. Employees continued to work in the London office as the firm searched for a buyer. Cambridge Analytica was backed by Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer, daughters of hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer .
